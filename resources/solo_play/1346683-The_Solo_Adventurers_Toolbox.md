CHAPTER 1
Introduction  
This book was written with the intention of 
providing a comprehensive method for 
playing D&D without a dungeon master. 
Some might argue this goes against the 
spirit of the game. I strongly disagree. 
Some of the first D&D products came with 
solo adventures included, to help beginning 
players learn the basics of the game. So 
that’s one use for a solo adventure. Another 
is that not all players can find a game. Some 
may live in a remote town where they are 
the only person interested in D&D, or they 
may simply not know how to go about 
joining a group. Also, there are many long-
suffering Dungeon Masters who seem to 
always be the ones putting their hands up 
to run the game. This book was written for 
them, probably more than anyone else! 
The contents menu on the left-hand side of 
this pdf (access it now by clicking the 
bookmarks tab:      ) is how you will 
navigate between the many tables and 
resources in this book. Eventually, you will 
become familiar with where the tables you  
 
like to use are and will know how to get to 
them quickly. Adapt this menu as you see 
fit.  
Within these pages, you will find a wealth 
of resources to help you enjoy detailed, 
immersive solo adventures. There are 
random encounter tables, quest and 
encounter generators, urban and wilderness 
encounter tables, merchant tables, 
instructions about travel, downtime 
activities, and much more. Using this 
supplement and a simple question/answer 
mechanic, you can enjoy hours of DM-less 
play using the 5th Edition system.  
Over the years I have developed my own 
style of solo play which involves the use of 
a question/answer mechanic (Mythic GM 
Emulator), random dungeon generation 
tables (from the DMG), loot tables (also 
DMG, as well as a number of resources 
from DM’s Guild), encounter tables (DM’s 
Guild / several useful websites) and a 
number of tools of my own.  
That’s a lot of different resources to access 
in one session. The idea came to me 
t
4

## Page 5

recently that a collection of all such tables 
could be gathered into one product.  
But obviously, creating tables for 
everything that your PC might encounter 
during a solo play session is a big task! 
Crafting my own versions of the tools I’ve 
been using has taken a while.  
Some of you who are experienced with this 
style of play will use the tables you want 
from this product and add other tables of 
your choosing to accentuate 
your adventures. 
This is highly 
encouraged. This 
book has been 
designed as a 
catch-all, but if 
you feel 
something is 
missing please let 
the author know 
through DM’s 
Guild. That way, 
subsequent 
revisions can be 
even more 
comprehensive, based 
on your input! The idea is 
that you should be able to 
generate all of your 
adventure elements just 
using this supplement, and 
I certainly don’t pretend 
like I’m going to be 
able to think of 
everything the first time.  
 
How To Use This Book 
Spend a few minutes now to skim through 
the whole book, taking in the basics of each 
chapter. You’ll probably discover that some 
of the chapters and systems will be suited 
to your style of play, and in other instances, 
you will have your own systems that you 
prefer to use instead. The final chapter 
contains an example of gameplay using the 
mechanics in this book, which would be 
ideal to read after your skim-through. You 
might find that useful, to put everything 
into context. 
Also, don’t overlook the Dungeon Master’s 
Guide. Within its pages, you will find a 
wealth of resources for solo adventuring. 
Suggestions are given throughout this book 
as to how to use the mechanics, tables and 
generators to facilitate your solo play, but 
in reality, you can use the resources you 
find in here however you want. There are 
no firm rules. You may decide to use the 
whole book, but choose encounters rather 
than rolling for them - that’s fine. 
You may choose to use Chapter 
14, (the Story Element 
Interaction tables), in 
conjunction with 
Chapter 2 (the 
question/answer 
mechanic), and nothing 
else, and that’s fine 
also.  
Simply think of this 
book as a collection of 
resources that 
hopefully contain 
some (and maybe all) 
of the resources you 
need for a satisfying 
solo experience. If 
you have a copy of 
Dungeon Master’s 
Guide and the Player’s 
Handbook, these will 
be extremely useful 
resources.  
 
 
 
Solo Adventuring 
Within D&D 
When the Red Basic Box was issued back in 
the early 80s, I vividly remember playing 
through the little dungeon that served as 
the intro to the Player’s Handbook. I was in 
my sister’s apartment / flat with 
Thompson Twins and Billy Idol playing in 
the background, and making maps in my 
school maths book. What a great 
experience, rolling those light blue dice 
which were so different and cool, defeating 
monsters and exploring dungeons!

I’d already had some experience playing a 
solo RPG-based system. Ian Livingstone 
and Steve Jackson’s Fighting Fantasy 
Gamebooks such as Warlock of Firetop 
Mountain and Citadel of Chaos were already 
making their mark, and in the pre-internet, 
Pac-Man days, those adventures were a 
revelation.  
Of course, Dungeons & Dragons is all about 
group play, and it wasn’t long before I’d 
assembled a cast of fellow nerds from my 
neighbourhood. Together we would 
regularly play, with me usually filling the 
role of DM. I delighted in creating mega-
dungeons full of nasty traps and surprises, 
and we had loads of fun.  
And I still continue to play in groups to 
this day, mostly through Roll20, which is 
an amazing tool that I use for many 
purposes. These days, I don’t seem to be 
able to get a D&D game together (despite 
living in a city of close to 400k people) but 
I’ve got friends who are into board games, 
so at least I get to scratch that itch.   
But there are always times between games 
when a group isn’t available, and this is 
where solo gaming comes in. I’ve been 
inspired towards writing solo adventures 
for Fifth Edition because I’ve always been 
into them, right from the days of Fighting 
Fantasy, Lone Wolf, Demonspawn, Grail 
Quest, Way of the Tiger, and the original 
Basic Red Box.  
I have devoted the last couple of years to 
writing solo gamebook-style adventures for 
D&D. A few of my titles are Death Knight’s 
Squire, Tyrant of Zhentil Keep, and Citadel of 
the Raven. These are structured, multi-path 
adventures with premade encounters, and 
are available on Dungeon Master’s Guild. I 
put a lot of time and love into crafting these 
quests, and the feedback has been brilliant.  
A system called Mythic GM Emulator 
caught my attention last year (although it’s 
older than that), with its system of asking 
questions and crafting your own adventure 
as it is played. Used in conjunction with all 
sorts of random encounter generators, 
dungeon generators and the like which I 
found online, it was like a light turning on. 
This was a fantastic way to adventure 
freely within the Forgotten Realms (or any 
world) and placed no restrictions on choice 
or anything else.  
I came up with another system to tie in 
with D&D called “Tables of Doom” which 
was more open-ended than my gamebook 
adventures. This presented random rooms 
that connected together, accompanied by a 
large array of tables to generate loot, 
monsters, traps etc. This was well received 
also.  
Recently the idea occurred to me that all 
these elements could be combined into one 
system, to bridge those times between more 
established quests like the gamebooks, or 
modules run using supplements such as 
Olly Gibson’s Elminster’s Guide to Solo 
Adventuring (also available on DM’s Guild) 
which is a guide to converting full party 
adventures into solos. Hence the 
supplement you are now perusing!  
I have combined a question/answer 
mechanic (a seriously pared-down version 
6

---

## Page 7

of the Mythic mechanic) with encounter 
tables, and a whole lot of generators, as 
well as guidelines on travel and the like, to 
give players a system that they can use 
either between adventures, or as the basis 
for a full solo campaign. This has been in 
the works for some time, and it is great to 
finally pass it over to you, the player, to see 
what you think! 
There are a number of DM-friendly 
resources in here also, such as NPC 
generators, Story and encounter 
generators, weather tables, Wilderness and 
Urban encounter tables and many other 
things that could be useful in crafting a 
campaign (possibly as you, the DM, plays 
through it!) 
Thanks for picking up this supplement, 
now go ahead and get stuck into some 
proper adventuring!  
I really hope you enjoy it.   
 
Getting Started: 
Freeform Solo Play 
If you want to simply start your character’s 
story, and see where events take them, then 
your best approach is probably to pick a 
location within your setting and place them 
there. Start interacting with local elements 
(accessing information from whatever 
setting or campaign resources you have to 
hand), or, pick a destination for them to 
travel to, send them on their way and see 
what happens.  
Go to Chapter 3 “Travelling” and follow 
the directions in there.  
 
Getting Started: 
Quest-based Solo 
Play 
If you want to just rip straight into the 
action without any mucking around, then 
go to Chapter 7: Quest Generator and create a 
quest for your character to hear about. 
Perhaps they hear it in a tavern (of all 
places) or perhaps an NPC gives it to them. 
There are tables in that chapter for 
generating quests, and a table for 
determining how you hear about it, which 
will generate additional story elements. 
You can base your PC or PCs in a village, 
which they can use as the base for their 
adventures, and have an NPC (a local 
noble/priest / important identity) act as 
their quest-giver. For an example of 
gameplay using the quest-based play 
model, go to Chapter 18: Example Gameplay 
Session. 
 
Your Creativity 
Required 
Since you are playing the part of DM and 
player, you will need to exercise your 
creativity in giving your PCs a surprising 
and interesting experience. Fortunately, 
there are many tools included herein to 
help you achieve that purpose. Have a look 
below for a summary of each chapter and 
its contents.  
  
Skill Checks 
It is expected that, as you play, you will 
make skill checks as you see appropriate for 
your PCs. For this purpose, and if no other 
option is apparent, you can use the DCs 
given on p.238 of the DMG as your guide.

Overview Of The 
Book’s Structure 
I have tried to arrange this book logically 
so that each chapter follows naturally on 
from the last.  
Chapter 2: In the next chapter, we will 
examine the question/answer mechanic 
that I have created for use with the 
resources in this book. This simple system 
allows you to gain answers to questions, 
much in the same way as a system like 
Mythic. You may prefer to use the Mythic 
system, or another similar system, in place 
of this. A question/answer mechanic is 
indispensable for free-form solo 
adventuring. The one I have created for 
this supplement is a simplified version of 
those offered elsewhere.  
Chapter 3: Deals with travel, modes of 
travel, weather, camping, unmarked 
settlements and the like. It follows 
naturally on to the next chapter… 
Chapter 4: Wilderness encounters. In this 
chapter, you will find 100 random 
wilderness encounters, all with an open-
ended nature so that they can be 
interpreted differently every time.  
Chapter 5: The same as above, but for 
urban settings.  
Chapter 6: The same as above, but for 
dungeon settings.  
Chapter 7: Contains tools for generating 
quests for your solo PC or PCs. 
Chapter 8: Contains tables for the random 
generation of dungeons and their contents.  
Chapter 9: Contains tables for the random 
generation of wilderness and its contents.  
Chapter 10: Contains guidance on 
merchants and shopping while in cities. 
Chapter 11: Contains guidance on 
downtime activities for your solo PC. 
Chapter 12: Contains ideas to guide 
roleplay in the solo format.  
Chapter 13: Tables for the random 
generations of any number of NPCs you 
might meet on your travels.  
Chapter 14: A collection of tables designed 
to generate an infinite number of random 
encounters, and also answer detailed 
questions framed by the player.  
Chapter 15: Deals with monster tactics 
and intentions during combat encounters. 
Chapter 16: A method for generating 
endless monster encounters for your PC or 
PCs. Organized by terrain and CR. 
Chapter 17: Loot Tables. Individual and 
hoard charts organized by CR. 
Chapter 18: Example Solo Play Session. If 
you are a bit overwhelmed by all this 
material and want to see how it works in 
action, head to this chapter for a breakdown 
of an example session run by the author 
using these mechanics.  
 
Dice, Mechanics, 
Action! 
The tables contained herein are designed to 
provide adventure and excitement for your 
characters. But what to do if there is not 
much happening? 
Well, the first thing you could do is switch 
to quest-based play. Rather than having your 
PCs interact with the environment and 
seeing what results, you could explicitly 
give them quests to carry out.  
But sometimes, you might feel that your 
PCs aren’t expected to always be engaged 
in a quest. At times, they might travel to a 
town and spend several days there with 
nothing really happening. This is probably 
a bit closer to how their lives would really 
play out, but it may not be exactly what 
you desire from your solo roleplaying 
experience.  
However, if constant excitement is your 
thing, there is another, very simple way to 
generate action.  
Ask questions.  
Use the question/answer mechanic 
(Chapter 2) to ask questions that might 
generate action.  
Below are some sample questions to get 
things moving again. 
 
• Does anyone noteworthy learn of the player’s 
arrival in town? 
• Do things appear normal here? 
• Is my character’s progress left undisturbed? 
• Are there any interesting rumours 
circulating? 
8

## Page 9

• Do I see someone interesting in this tavern? 
• Is there an Adventurer’s Guild in this town? 
• Is everything well in this town? 
• Is anyone acting strange? 
• Is anything threatening the town at this 
stage? 
• Do we meet any other adventurers here? 
 
Journalling 
It is recommended that you keep a journal 
of your PC’s adventures. It gives you a 
reference and helps to solidify the events as 
they take place. It also makes for great 
reading. You can even turn the storyline 
into an adventure if you’re a DM (which 
many solo players are - DMs who never get 
a chance to play as a PC and thus are 
driven to the solo style of play!) 
A hands-on, non-computer-based roleplay 
style is also satisfying and moves the solo 
style of gaming even closer to the feel of 
actual D&D. Obviously, this means that 
you’ll probably only make cursory notes 
into your journal (if you’re doing it by 
hand). However, the combination of minis, 
a flipmat, dice, and printed versions of your 
solo adventuring resources can give rise to 
an authentic-feeling style of play.  
 
Satisfying Gameplay 
My personal conviction as a player is that 
solo D&D, using this style of gameplay, is 
best when you remove all other 
distractions. If you are playing from a 
laptop, it is recommended you close all 
other tabs except the ones relevant to your 
gameplay, and just hone your focus down 
to the gameplay, and nothing else. Switch 
off social media and email, and resist the 
temptation to look at it. Such distractions 
break the immersion of your game and 
result in an inferior experience. Perhaps 
look up some appropriate “RPG 
Adventuring Music” to provide a bit of 
ambient background. This will result in a 
much more satisfying experience.  
If possible, you could even set yourself up 
with a flipmat, a large map of your world, 
your favourite dice, printed resources and 
miniatures, as well as your journal and 
some printed information on the area you 
are journeying through. Using these 
resources, you can play a tabletop solo 
D&D adventure. If journeying through the 
Forgotten Realms, you could even go and 
pick up a resource like the Forgotten Realms 
Campaign Guide which was published for 
Fourth Edition, or a guide for a different

## Page 10

setting such as Adventurer’s Guide to 
Eberron. Setting yourself up like this will 
take your soloing to another level and 
should result in a highly satisfying solo 
experience. !
 
Flipmats & Other 
Accessories 
Flipmats (available online or from your 
local game store) are excellent for adding 
that extra dimension to your solo play. Buy 
the dry marker erasable kind and get 
yourself a nice little selection of whiteboard 
markers. Random dungeon generation 
tools such as those included herein work 
well with flipmats, as you can just draw in 
as you go! 
In the scenario pictured above, I used the 
miniatures I have available (a very small 
selection) to dictate the characters and 
villains making up the adventure. These 
miniatures are from The Legend of Drizzt 
and Dungeonquest board games, and I 
simply rolled up PCs to fit their visual 
characteristics.  
The circular tokens are metal washers with 
sticky paper (on which I have printed 
tokens) adhered to their surface. Work with 
what you’ve got!

Chapter 2 
Unique 
Question/Answer 
Mechanic 
There are a few excellent question/answer 
systems out there. The Mythic system is 
outstanding and has been extensively used 
by the author, and by many others, in 
generating hours of enjoyable solo play.  
In Olly Gibson’s Elminster’s Guide to Solo 
Adventuring (available on DM’s Guild) an 
elegant mechanic for answering questions 
is provided, which could also be used in this 
context. This pdf is a useful resource and 
should be considered if you’re interested in 
solo adventuring.  
The website RPG Solo is another great 
resource that supports solo adventuring 
and incorporates Q/A mechanics, and 
should be explored also.  
If you are unfamiliar with question/answer 
systems, the basic idea is that the player 
asks questions to find out where the story 
goes next.  
Example: The player is in a tavern, and is 
being harassed by a group of bards who 
insist on serenading him until he gives 
them some gold to go away.  
In this situation, the player may ask the 
question: 
“If I yell at them to go away, will they?” 
The player rolls, and discerns that they 
seem determined, and that this might not 
work, so instead, he tries a different route.  
“If I act completely crazy, will they go 
away?” 
The likelihood of this is determined to be 
Possible and so the player attempts the roll, 
a straight d20 in this case, no modifier. 
(Consult the table below). It is your 
discretion to decide what modifier to use 
with the roll. The different modifiers are 
found in the table below.  
He rolls a 9, which is a maybe, and 
subsequently decides that a performance 
check is necessary in order to convince the 
bards that he really is insane. Check made 
successfully, he decides that his player picks 
up his tankard of ale and pours it over his 
head, and then takes off his socks and stuffs 
them in his ears. Somewhat perplexed and 
unsettled, the bards depart. 
The question/answer system provided in 
this chapter should be used whenever you 
need to know an answer that isn’t supplied 
by a table or some other mechanic. In 
general, through my system of quest and 
environment generation, I have tried to 
provide a concrete system of adventure 
creation that is revealed as the PC moves 
through the adventure. However, there is 
only so deep that I can go with detail, and 
so a question/answer mechanic is 
necessary. I’ve provided a simple method of 
providing an answer to any question that 
might need to be asked in the context of an 
adventure.  
 
STEP 1: FRAME A YES/NO 
QUESTION 
The first stage is to come up with a 
question. This question needs to be framed 
in such a way that it can be answered with 
one of the following three words: yes, no, 
maybe. 
Example: Is this town currently 
peaceful?  
 
STEP 2: DETERMINE DIFFICULTY 
MODIFIER 
Given all circumstances, how likely is the 
occurrence? 
 
LIKELIHOOD 
MOD 
Impossible 
-6 
Highly Unlikely 
-4 
Unlikely 
-2 
Possible 
0 
Likely 
+2 
Highly Likely 
+4 
A Certainty 
+6

---

## Page 12

With the example question given above, 
(“Is this town currently peaceful?”) some 
factors that would influence the likelihood 
are the political situation in the area, recent 
events, the demographic, etc.  
NOTE: From now on, we will refer to the 
question/answer mechanic and its 
associated d20 roll as the “Q/A roll”. 
 
STEP 3: MAKE A D20 Q/A ROLL 
(adding or subtracting the modifier) 
 
Q/A Roll Result Table 
d20  
RESULT 
1-6 
NO 
7-12 
MAYBE 
13-20 
YES 
 
MAYBE? 
If your result is maybe, then there is some 
other condition that needs to be fulfilled for 
the thing to happen (or not happen, as the 
case may be), perhaps an appropriate ability 
check to overcome a relevant obstacle or 
achieve a stated goal. Or, it could be that 
other yes/no/maybe questions need to be 
asked in order to determine what the 
condition is.  Another way of getting 
answers to a maybe is to make a roll or two 
on the Situations table in Chapter 15. That 
might add the necessary detail. Or, if you 
get a maybe roll, you can just decide 
whether it’s yes or no yourself. 
 
TRICK TO REMEMBER 
To avoid having to repeatedly refer back to 
this chapter, memorise this: 7-12 = 
maybe. If you can remember that, 
everything else will fall into place.  
You’ll notice the modifiers also scale up and 
down by twos. They shouldn’t be too hard 
to memorise either.  
 
 
 
YOUR CREATIVITY IS 
PARAMOUNT 
Although you can answer every question 
with this mechanic, that doesn’t necessarily 
mean that you should. Not everything needs 
to be answered using this. Recently while 
soloing, my adventurers (I play solo with 2 
PCs) were given an eagle by two female 
witches. A Q/A roll determined that the 
eagle could talk, and another that it was a 
human spirit trapped inside an eagle’s body. 
I rolled on the NPC tables to find out who 
it was, and it was an 80-year-old female 
commoner, and then the thought struck me 
that she paid to be transferred there 
because she was sick and dying, and liked 
the idea of being able to fly. Perhaps so she 
could shit on all the people who had 
wronged her in life!  
This story that just occurred to me out of 
the blue was too good not to use, and so my 
2 PCs now had a new (and possibly quite 
useful) companion! 
 
Specific Questions 
If you have a specific question that needs 
answering, which cannot be framed as a 
yes/no question, then use the Situations 
(Verbs) Table in Chapter 14. This is a list 
of 499 verbs that give single word answers 
to any questions, which you can loosely 
interpret to formulate an answer.  
Example: Recently, my solo PC Kite in the 
Wind, a tabaxi fighter, came across a 
deserted battlefield. He wanted to search 
the area.  rolled investigation, and it came 
up 19, so he definitely found something. 
But what? 
I rolled on the Chapter 15 Verbs list, and 
got the word “bribe.” 
I related this to a similar word, “payment”, 
and decided that the winning force 
appeared to be mercenaries, paid 
mercenaries, due to the assassin-like 
wounds on the bodies of the defeated army. 
So a bit of a reach was necessary, but it 
provided an interesting plot hook. Onwards 
to the next town, where the story behind 
this slaughter might be discovered.

Chapter 3:  
Travelling/Camping/ 
Arriving in 
Settlements 
 
Introduction 
What follows is a stripped-down set of 
rules for travelling solo between 
settlements. These rules will be useful if 
you are not particularly bothered about 
wilderness adventures and would rather get 
to a dungeon or town and involved in some 
adventuring in urban or subterranean 
settings.  
Chapter 9 contains expanded rules for 
wilderness travel, and, paired with this 
chapter, will generate wilderness-based 
solo adventures.  
 
Start & End Points 
The start and end points of your travel are 
instrumental in determining what you 
encounter along the way. What sort of 
terrain are your PCs travelling through? 
What is the current weather? What about 
finding suitable campsites? And of course, 
there is always the question of random 
encounters.  
There is a wealth of information available 
in published WotC and DM’s Guild 
material (and also on various wikis such as 
the Forgotten Realms Wiki) to help you 
furnish your travel with interesting detail. 
But, keep in mind that your PCs will not 
always be cognizant of all of this 
information. 
 
Modes of Travel & 
Travel Speeds 
Determine how you are travelling between 
locations. Are you using a mount? (This 
will need to be purchased). If so, you will 
need to go to Chapter 10: Merchants & 
Shopping to determine the likelihood of 
finding a horse trader in the town where 
you are. Prices for mounts are found in the 
PHB p.157, and on the table below.  
The use of a mount will determine how 
quickly you travel between locations, but 
bear in mind that a standard riding horse 
only travels 30 miles per day. To really 
increase your speed, you need a warhorse 
which is quite a sizable investment, 
especially for a low-level PC.  
The next step is to determine the distance 
between your locations. This is crucial in 
determining how many days it will take 
you to get from point to point, and thus 
how many encounters you might have.  
  
See DMG pp.242-243, and PHB pp.155-157 
and pp.181-183 for more details on travel 
and travel speeds, and the carrying capacity 
of various mounts. Once you have the 
details of your mount, note them down on 
your character sheet so you don’t have to 
keep referring back to the rulebooks. 
Remember that the following speeds are 
halved when travelling over difficult 
terrain.

Weather is a major consideration when 
travelling. Consult the DMG (p.109) or use 
the table below to determine what the 
weather is doing on any particular day or 
night. Where the weather gives the option 
Hot, if the roll is towards the lower end of 
the range, it is warm. If higher, it is hot. 
The results scale upwards. 
Adjust by terrain also. If in a desert, add 5. 
If in mountains or ice steppes, subtract 5.

GEOGRAPHIC 
FEATURES 
Inspect the map of the area you are 
travelling through carefully. Is there a river 
that you must cross? If so, has it been 
raining lately? The river could be raging, 
or if high summer, only ankle deep.  
If there is a range of mountains, how will 
you get across? You may need more 
information in order to discover the pass 
that leads through. Or, perhaps like a 
certain famous adventuring party, there is a 
legendary tunnel under the mountains that 
you must enter to get through the 
mountain range.

TABLE TO GENERATE 
NUMBER OF 
WILDERNESS 
ENCOUNTERS 
Use the table below to determine how 
many encounters your PC might have on 
the road while travelling. If they are 
camped up and resting, there is a different 
mode for determining whether they are 
disturbed. This table below is for when 
your character is on the move, whether they 
choose to travel during the day or at night.

Determine how many d100 rolls to make 
using the table above.  
Whatever number you arrive at, make that 
many d100 rolls. For every roll of 25 or 
below, you have an encounter. 
You could use the pre-made Wilderness 
Encounter Tables (Chapter 4), or you could 
use the Story Element Interaction Tables 
(Chapter 14) to determine what it is you 
meet on the road.  
 
UNMARKED 
SETTLEMENTS 
As you travel, you will come across 
settlements and villages that aren’t 
necessarily marked on maps. These “empty 
spaces” on the official maps of the 
Forgotten Realms (or whatever setting you 
are adventuring through) are where you 
can really begin to exercise your creativity. 
Are the settlements human? What are they 
known for? What is the general attitude of 
the population, and what significant events 
are happening in the area currently? The 
question/answer mechanic will help you in 
this regard, or you could consult the tables 
on pp.112-116 of the DMG.  
 
POSSIBILITY OF 
FINDING UNMARKED 
SETTLEMENT 
Roll 1d4-1 to determine how many chance 
rolls to make between each marked 
settlement. For example, a d4 roll of 4 
means 3 chance rolls. In a highly populated 
part of the Forgotten Realms (or wherever 
your solo campaign is set), that means 3 
rolls of a d100. For every one of these that 
is 20 or below (20% chance for a high-
density population area), you find one 
unmarked settlement. It might take you 4 
days to travel from one marked settlement 
to another. Space out these chance rolls 
however you like. (Note: this means 3 
chance rolls during your entire travel time 
between the two marked settlements. Not 3 
chance rolls per day).  
Unmarked settlements will be villages, 
hamlets, stationed garrisons, forestry 
worker encampments and the like -  
nothing larger than that.

NATURE OF 
UNMARKED 
SETTLEMENT 
Use the following table to establish the size 
and nature of your settlement. NOTE: 
Wherever you see a percentage value in a 
table, that is a direction to make a d100 
roll. For example, “25% abandoned” means 
roll a d100. If you get 25 or below, the 
camp is abandoned.

about the settlement, for example, whether 
it is inhabited by humans or orcs!

CAMPING 
When travelling in the wilderness, it is 
obviously necessary that you make camp at 
some stage. Your adventurers need rest and 
replenishment, and finding a suitable 
campsite is the way to achieve that. Below 
are some guidelines as to how to manage 
this.

RAIN 
If it’s raining, do you have a tent? If not, 
another survival check might be required to 
see if you can construct a bivouac. If so, 
what materials are around? Adjust DC 
accordingly, and make the roll.  
 
NO CAMPSITE? 
If the players fail to find a campsite, they 
can attempt to rest anyway, but one of two 
things will happen: 
• 
The likelihood of being disturbed is 
increased. 
• 
They may not get a full rest which 
may result in them only getting a 
short rest rather than a long rest.  
 
SOLUTIONS 
They can continue travelling, which will 
result in another d100 roll to see whether 
they encounter something. For every roll of 
25 and below, they have an encounter. 
After travelling for this amount of time, 
another mile or two, they can roll to find a 
campsite again. 
This is why it is sometimes a good idea to 
solo with 2 (or even more) PCs! Different 
characters bring different strengths. Once 
you get adept at this style of play, you may 
16

## Page 17

wish to give your solo PC a companion or 
two.  
 
DISTURBANCES WHILE 
CAMPING 
Make a Q/A roll to determine whether 
your PC is disturbed while asleep. Adjust 
likelihood modifier according to population 
area, and how much you aced the Survival 
check by.  
For example, Leytra, an elven ranger, got a 
15 on his survival check to find a camp.  
He then makes a Q/A roll to answer the 
question “Am I disturbed while resting”, 
with the modifier of “Unlikely” (-2). This 
modifier is used since he did well on the 
survival check, finding a nice, secluded 
campsite.  
Rolling a 14, the result is 12 when the 
modifier is subtracted. This results in an 
answer of “Maybe.” 
Player decides that it’s 50/50, so she makes 
a d100 roll, getting a 16. Leytra is 
disturbed while resting.

ARRIVING IN 
SETTLEMENTS 
Arriving in settlements that are marked on 
the map increases the chances of 
encounters, as there is more to interact 
with, concentrated in a small space.  
For Forgotten Realms settlements, consult 
a resource such as Forgotten Realms 
Campaign Setting (available on DM’s Guild) 
locating details of that town, notable 
locations and persons, and local history 
that your PCs might discover while they 
are there. This will inform your adventures 
within the town, giving them a unique 
flavour.  
Obviously, there is a lot more going on in a 
town than out in the wilderness. There are 
more people, and more events and 
situations to interact with. So your PC or 
PCs will probably be kept quite busy 
keeping up with the events in the town, and 
any plot threads they might be following. 
Towns and cities, after all, are where 
adventures start. 
Then of course, there’s the old tavern. A 
great place to meet NPCs. Use the (slightly 
racy) tavern name generator below, or use 
the more generic one in the DMG (p.113). 
Then, proceed to the following table which 
will provide more information on what sort 
of establishment you have found.

PROACTIVE PCs 
Good adventurers don’t just sit around 
waiting for action to come to them. They 
go out and find it. Get out and about and 
see what you can dig up. What’s the state of 
affairs in the city? What interests do your 
characters have? Are they more likely to go 
and watch an underground pit fight or visit 
a tavern, or are they more suited to 
spending hours burrowing through the 
stacks of some obscure library? Any one of 
these can lead to a quest. Adventure hooks 
are everywhere.  
Also, the multiple NPCs that your 
characters meet can deliver quests to them 
as well. Usually, these will be tied up with 
those NPC’s interests. Who is that 
mysterious dwarf who occupies the same 
corner table of the inn you are staying at, 
every evening without fail? She keeps to 
herself, but you are certain something is 
going on with her… 
Every day as you are moving about, getting 
your business done, you will also have 
random encounters, just like in the wild.

Chapter 4:  
Wilderness 
Encounters 
 
What follows is a d100 table of premade 
wilderness encounters. You can use these 
every now and then to provide ready-made 
events for your PCs. Alternately, you can 
use the tables in Chapter 16 to generate an 
infinite number of random encounters.  
Some of the encounters listed below will 
result in quests, the generation of which is 
covered in Chapter 7. Other rolls will result 
in a monster being encountered, which will 
take you to Chapter 16. 
The encounters below have been 
somewhat  left open-ended so that there is 
potential for them to be different every 
time. Use the question/answer mechanic 
(Chapter 2) to fill in the details. Or, you 
could use the Story Element Interaction 
tables (Chapter 14) to spice things up a bit.

Chapter 5:  
Urban Encounters 
 
You have two options for generating 
encounters. One is using the Story Element 
Interaction tables, which are designed to 
generate an infinite amount of random 
encounters. These are found in Chapter 14. 
There is also a table there which 
determines simple, open-ended urban 
events which could be interpreted in many 
ways. (eg: Fire in building / storm / 
election etc.). This could also be used.  
The other is method rolling for a premade 
encounter from the table below. Some of 
the encounters listed below will result in 
quests, the generation of which is covered 
in Chapter 7. Other rolls will result in a 
monster being encountered, which will take 
you to Chapter 16. 
Consult Chapter 3 for information on the 
number of encounters per day and other 
issues.

they appeared to have a disfigurement. Perhaps they were just trying to hide from 
people. 
5 
A guided tour proceeds past, as the guide drops a particularly tasty snippet of 
local knowledge which the PC was unaware of.  
6 
A shady figure beckons from an alley. They have wondrous items for sale, they 
say.

Two old ladies, witches of some sort by the look of them, beg you to take a 
creature off their hands. (Roll Creature Table, Chapter 14). “It never shuts up!” 
they tell you. “Please, we’ll pay you! We just want to be rid of the damnded thing!” 
The creature is the trapped soul of a former adventurer... 
8 
Two men are arguing about something. One turns to a PC and says, "You look 
like a reasonable man. What do you think?" Could be literally anything at all, and 
could result in combat, a job, or just more arguing. 
9 
Quest board with rewards for deeds done. Someone has rats in their cellar, 
missing townsperson in the woods neaby, simple things (or complex!) that give 
you little things to do that keep you exploring the city, making contacts, and 
earning gold/interesting items. Use Chapter 14 tables or Q/A rolls to generate.

Two local thugs are strong arming a merchant for gold. You can help the 
merchant, but doing so annoys the local gang. Variation: The merchant is a thief, 
and the thugs are trying to recover their stolen money. 
12 
You notice a group of villagers attempting to put out a nearby house fire. This 
looks like it could easily spread to neighbouring houses, possibly affecting the 
whole town. 
13 
A peddler attempts to sell you a trinket or minor magic item.

A giant rat crawls out of a storm drain and gets into a fight with a dog.

unsuccessful, you  disadvantage all charisma and stealth related rolls until you 
have a bath and change clothes. (Optional: make a con save vs filth fever). 
28 
A scrap of paper is pressed into your hand by a young man, who looks at you 
desperately before turning and running away. You turn over the note and read it. 
“Please help, he’s coming for us all!” 
29 
A member of the local guard asks you what your business is in town.  
30 
“Stop, thief!” You feel your arms being grabbed. The local guard apprehend you, 
accusing you of stealing jewels belonging to a noble/royal. Searching your 
clothes, and/or bag, they successfully turn up the jewels in question. You, 
however, have never seen them before.

A lady / young man on a balcony blows you a kiss and then runs away.

A man tumbles out a tavern window. He’s fully dressed in nobleman’s garb. A 
female half-orc jumps out after him, letting out a warcry as he gets up and runs 
for his life screaming for help. Do you help her and run him down or do you get in 
her way? Possible: No matter who you help they both begin attacking you!  
44 
A street dog runs past with a human hand in its mouth - wearing a large, very 
obvious jeweled ring. Dog chase or find out what happened to the owner of the 
ring (and hand). 
45 
Someone's horse is spooked and charges through the streets. whether it’s 
dragging a wagon or just a rider, it is panicked and needs to be stopped.  
46 
You find a map, discarded, on the street, or just a fragment of one, which arouses 
your curiosity. It shows a ruin, and there is a sketch of an artifact. Magical? 
Perhaps a local mage could help you decode this... 
47 
 A drunk just wakes up nearby. “Wha… where am I?! My… my weapons! My 
belongings! They’re gone!” 
48 
 You stop to listen to a talented storyteller relate a story about a famous 
adventurer and his beast companion. Part of the story is unresolved, however, and 
gets you thinking...

You feel a thwack in the side of your head, and turn to see that a bunch of drunk

A wizard is carrying a bagful of potions when suddenly the bag rips (perhaps it 
catches on a nail sticking out of a building, or it catches on a passing cart) and 
several potions drop out and smash on the ground, exploding with various 
dramatic effects.   
58 
A jeweller emerges from his shop, screaming that he’s been robbed by dwarves. A 
nearby dwarf asks him for proof, but all he has to say is, “Of course it’s dwarves, 
they lust after gems constantly!” 
59 
A female priest is castigating a businesswoman who has set up her wares before 
the temple (of Lathander, perhaps? Any good-aligned god). Except this business is 
no ordinary business - a female slaver is parading her wares, selling slaves to

PC hears a rumour about a job that a local priest might have. Apparently, or so 
the rumour goes, something is going on in the sacred catacombs beneath the 
streets. 
78 
You pass a house which is all boarded up, the gates locked. A passerby informs 
you that this is the house of a local nobleman who hasn’t been seen in years.  
79 
You see a dice game going on in an alley off the street you are walking down.  
80 
 A cleric stands atop a box on the roadside, spouting vitriol and nasty rumours 
about the town’s leader or leaders. The cleric has attracted quite a crowd. 
81 
A group of protestors has set up outside the Town Hall, protesting the new road 
which is planned to run right through the middle of their settlement, some 
distance out of town.

A merchant asks you to mind his cart for him while he chases a thief who has

time...

A street urchin appears, promising divine favour if the PC comes and volunteers 
an hour of service at a nearby temple.

A shopkeeper is attacking a wasp nest outside of his shop with a broom. He 
dislodges it and it crashes to the ground, engulfing him in a Swarm of Insects! 
85 
Two half-orcs are engaged in a full-on brawl outside a nearby tavern. Apparently 
one thinks the other cheated at dice.

Religious pilgrims making their way quietly through the streets are being mocked

A tattered cloak blows up the street. Catching hold of it, you find a note in one of 
its pockets.

Someone has released a hallucinogenic substance into the air, and people are in

A distraught mother cannot find her child and is convinced it has been kidnapped. 
She is moving from person to person, begging for help.

A sudden gust of wind whips through the town, sending stalls toppling over, hats 
flying, stacks of parchment fluttering down the street. Perhaps the PC discovers 
something as a result. 
91 
A dwarf, armed with greataxe, is threatening a cowering halfling, who is shaking 
with fear. The dwarf is living with rage, but has just been disarmed by the town 
guard. What’s the situation here? Has the halfling wronged him in some way?

An overturned cart ahead is causing gridlock - the street is jammed with traffic.

Dead beast or monster carcass. What happened here? 
37 
You find a strange growth in this area, on the dungeon walls. Is it a moss of some 
kind? 
38 
Part of the floor has crumbled away, revealing a black, empty space below.  
39 
A door covered in moss, with a large knocker. Looks like it’s been transplanted 
here from someone’s garden. 
40 
You enter a tomblike area. All of the coffins are child-sized.   
41 
Strange vines have grown all through here, creeping around the stonework and 
gradually, over time, destroying parts of the masonry. How did they get in here? 
42 
You see a statue of  a wizard in the middle of this area. The  plaque beneath reads 
“I am Fennishaw Eldsight. Speak my name and bring me to life, if you dare!”  
43 
You hear voices ahead, and turn the corner to see a barbarian parleying with an 
ogre! Apparently they are discussing what the ogre’s price is for releasing the 
half-orc he is currently holding hostage.

## Page 32

44 
A voice repeatedly whispers, “What do you seek?” No matter how you respond, it 
repeats the same question. (Perhaps until you give the true answer, at which point, 
you may get what you seek, but not as you expected!) Who does this voice belong 
to, if anyone? 
45 
The ceiling above you opens, and an unexpected NPC falls through screaming, 
hitting the ground in front of you! Roll NPC Tables to find out who it is.  
46 
This area is home to a mining operation. Enslaved humanoid children are toiling 
away, loading rocks into mine carts for ore processing. Their masters whip and 
force them to continue on, despite their obvious fatigue.  
47 
A middle-aged woman is slumped against the wall, sobbing. She is dressed in rags.  
48 
From nowhere, you hear a booming voice: “Take up your weapon, adventurer! 
You dare to trespass here, now you will face me in battle!” But no one appears. At 
least not yet… You hear laughing... 
49 
Suddenly a vision flickers before you, a vision of your ultimate goal in this 
dungeon. You do not recognize the room, but get some prior information about 
what you might be headed towards.  
50-
55 
TRAP! Roll on Traps table to find out what. 
56 
Graffiti on the wall: “Stop! Bridge out ahead! Go back, your doom is at hand!” 
57 
Nearby, you hear a dog barking madly, then another voice telling it to shut up! 
58 
You hear screaming, very faint, as if from far, far away.  
59 
You round the next corner and see two humanoids engaged in a heated quarrel. 
60 
Make a perception check, DC 14. If unsuccessful, you suddenly notice your pack is 
lighter. Randomly choose one item from your inventory (perhaps figure out a way 
to randomly roll for it). It has been stolen! You might get it back, but then again... 
61 
You come to a door on which a parchment is nailed. “Dungeon caretaker. 
Enquiries/complaints within.” 
62 
Suddenly the wall behind you explodes, and two adventurers enter through it. 
One is a goliath who has just punched his way through the masonry, the other 
appears to be a halfling sorcerer.  
63 
Ahead, two orc guards sit at a guard post. They appear to be playing dice.  
64 
A giant rat runs past you, closely followed by three hungry-looking goblins. They 
pay you no attention.  
65 
As you move through this area, make a perception check, DC 15. If you fail, you 
do not see a glyph on the wall and trigger an alarm spell! What comes to check?

66 
In a corner, a huge pile of rubbish festers. It is being picked through by some 
horrid beast or other. 
67 
You get the distinct impression that you are being followed. You even fancy you 
can smell whoever it is, and they smell rank.  
68 
You happen upon a massacre. The corpses of a dozen humanoids lie scattered.  
69 
A mist swirls about your feet.  
70 
You feel a hard shove in your back. When you turn to look, is anyone there? 
71 
Roll perception, DC 14. If successful you notice something in your periphery. A 
stone in the wall shuts with a scrape. Investigation roll, DC 12, to find the 
mechanism to open it. Beyond is a (d4) 1-2: passage, 3-4: room, containing an 
encounter (d4) 1: Easy, 2: Medium, 3: Hard, 4: No encounter. Clue 75%, Individual 
Loot 50%.  
72 
An old timer, clearly mad, is perched on a soapbox to the side of this passage, 
ranting about the current state of political affairs to an audience of one slightly 
amused boggart.  
73 
As you round the next corner, you catch sight of a lone humanoid. Make a stealth 
check, DC 14. If successful, you stay hidden and watch as they move a stone in the 
wall, place something behind it, then replace the stone. Then they depart.  
74 
You come across a proper dungeon - a locked room with bars, in which you see 
several ragged-looking prisoners. “Quick, break us out!” one of them exclaims 
when he sees you. 
75 
You come across an ornate door, attended by a spectral figure dressed in opulent 
clothes. The thing is non-hostile, and manning this door, like a doorman. Roll a 
d4. On a 1: He praises you and your obvious prowess as an adventurer. He seems 
to know a lot. The spectral doorman admits opens the door for you. On a 2: He 
begins insulting you, pointing out how awful your clothes are, how ugly you are, 
how terrible you smell! Make a wisdom check, DC 15. If you succeed, he 
congratulates you on your poise in the face of abuse and lets you through the 
door. On 3-4: He begins debating with you as to why you shouldn’t be admitted 
through the door. Make an intelligence check or a persuasion check, DC 14. If 
successful, you win the debate and he lets you through the door. The spectral 
doorkeeper cannot be attacked or moved. And the door only opens for him. (40% 
boss encounter).  
76 
A kindly little goblin appears with hat in hand, and begs your help in ridding him 
of a problem. He has just returned from a trip to the nearest town to find that his 
home has been taken over! Two levels down, his humble little abode that he 
shares with his wife and two little goblings, has been invaded by a horrible (insert 
level appropriate hard encounter here). If he could get your assistance in getting 
rid of this scourge, he will reward you with all his profits from his recent sales trip 
- 250 gp! And his wife will cook you a delicious pot of Tunnelslug Stew, finest in 
the dungeon, they say!

## Page 34

77 
You run into some rival adventurers, who happen to be there following the same 
leads as you. Will you team up with these NPCs? (Use NPC tables to determine 
who they are, skipping Profession and going straight to Class Tables).  
78 
You take one more step and… boom! You are in an utterly unfamiliar part of the 
dungeon. Abandon the map you have so far. You have stepped through a portal, 
and now are not even sure you are in the same dungeon, realm, or world! Where 
have you been transported?  
79 
You find a secret entrance to an opulent room, lined with bookshelves. A fire 
crackles in the hearth, and richly-patterned rugs and furniture decorate this cosy 
space. Who lives here? 
80 
You find small circular openings in the walls. Each contains a scroll. Withdrawing 
them, you see that they bear writing from some ancient civilization. These could 
be of great worth to an archaeologist, but first you will need to get them 
translated. What secrets do they hold? (Roll a d8. The scrolls are in 1: Infernal, 2: 
Abyssal, 3: Celestial, 4: Draconic, 5: Druidic, 6: Giant, 7: Primordial, 8: 
Undercommon. If you happen to speak the resultant language, use Q/A rolls to 
determine what they contain. Perhaps a quest! Or some valuable knowledge. They 
might be worth something, too, to the right buyer).  
81 
1d4-1 humanoids are arguing and do not notice your approach. One is a 
commander, the other(s) subordinate. The subordinate has failed in the execution 
of some task. The rest of your story will hopefully provide the context here. If you 
choose to attack, this will be a (d4) 1: Easy, 2-3: Medium, 4: Hard encounter. You 
may choose an appropriate enemy based on the encounter guidelines in Chapter 
16. Individual loot 50% (roll twice, once for each humanoid) 
82 
You find the shrine of a long-forgotten deity. (Loot Hoard 30%). Perhaps this 
deity tries to commune with you, attempting to find a new worshipper? 
83 
You see an ornate historical mural on a nearby wall, faded but obviously painted / 
carved by a master artist. As you watch, the figures in the mural come to life and 
begin to play out a scene hitherto unknown to you. You gain knowledge of this 
episode of history, and possibly of some previously undiscovered 
location/quest/relic associated with it. (Consult the history of your setting / use 
Q/A rolls to find out what… player’s choice!) 
84 
You enter a chamber where a sacrificial ceremony is taking place. Several 
humanoids are gathered around a plinth, about to sacrifice a live beast. Who 
knows what the outcome of this ritual will be? 
85 
You get the feeling you are being stalked by something, some invisible force. You 
see shadows, hear noises, feel a presence, but every time you turn you see nothing. 
Perhaps it will show itself eventually. Perhaps it is another adventurer, or 
perhaps… something more sinister. 
86 
In the next room, a gnome sits at a table in a sparse room before a chess board. He 
invites you to play. Playing requires a DC 15 deception or intelligence check. If 
successful, the gnome will gift you with a useful trinket of gnomish invention, or 
50 gp. If unsuccessful, you surrender an item of 50 gp worth. You can refuse this 
34

## Page 35

invitation if you wish. The gnome will also just talk if you want - he will welcome 
the company, and is a wealth of information about the dungeon.  
87 
You find an underground tavern, where dungeon denizens like to stop and get an 
ale every now and then before returning to their murderous exploits! It’s called 
The Delver’s Rest and the patronage is steady! (If this is too silly, re-roll).  
88 
You find a secret door to a chamber where an alchemist is busy preparing potions 
and tinctures of all kinds. He might be open to bartering, but is currently trying 
to prepare something that will “stop all hell breaking out in this place.” If you try 
to attack him, you find he is protected by an impenetrable magic barrier, which 
only he can let down. 
89 
You find a dimensional door into a forest, but can’t be sure if this wilderness is 
real, or simply an illusion to lead you into even greater danger.  
90 
In this area are some pools of greyish-green slime of unknown nature. Q/A and 
nature rolls to determine more about their nature.  
91 
If the party are holding torches, or there are torches or candles present in the 
area, something blows them all out suddenly. 
92 
The area is filled with a thick mist/fog, that hangs heavy and low to the ground. 
93 
In the distance a small girl dressed in rags can be seen standing near the wall. If 
players move toward her, she will turn and run through the nearest wall and 
disappear.  
94 
To the far side three skeletons hang on manacles, if they are inspected 1d6 rats 
will jump out at the PCs. 
95 
The ground here is earthen and covered with a top soil. It smells heavily of must 
and dirt. Root-like tendrils will start to appear out of the ground and start to 
grow up the walls. 
96 
A player is bitten on the hand (causing minimal if no damage). What did it?  
97 
A low rumble, then a deep cracking noise is heard directly above. The area shakes 
slightly, dust and small debris falls from the ceiling, then it stops. 
98 
A bard has stopped in this area to belt out a quick song to try and lift his own 
spirits. He’s been lost down here for days! He tells you that he’s managed to find 
his way up to this level with some difficulty, but that this dungeon descends many 
levels downward. He was held captive by some kind of humanoid until just 
recently. He’s absolutely starving, having had to subsist on dungeon moss and 
tunnelslugs for weeks.  
99 
You hear the sound of something heavy being dragged, coming from up ahead.  
100 
A large group of humanoids comes running down the tunnel towards you, their 
expressions showing absolute, abject terror. “RUN!” the lead one yells at you. 
“Save yourself, run, now!!!” Behind them, you see something BIG following...

CHAPTER 7 
QUEST GENERATOR 
 
HOW TO GENERATE 
QUESTS 
 
Quests come about because of problems. So, 
what possible problems could bring about a 
quest? 
After examining many published 
adventures, I have identified a set of main 
conflicts and resultant quests. 
Many adventures are formed of one or 
more of the below quests.  
We must remember that scale is something 
to consider. For example, “Invasion” below, 
might refer to a small band of evil 
humanoids, or the army of an entire 
nation.     
The table has been kept necessarily vague 
so that the adventure can easily slot into 
whatever environment your PC happens to 
be in, wilderness, urban, or dungeon. Using 
the Quest Generation Tables in 
conjunction with Q/A rolls (Chapter 2), 
you should be able to come up with an 
adventure that fits within the context of 
your current campaign.  
Generate your initial quest using the table 
directly below, then roll on the Quest 
Source Table, and finally proceed to the 
what-why-when-where-how-who questions 
listed afterwards to add more detail.  
NOTE: I do not pretend that the below list 
is exhaustive. This is just to get the 
creative juices flowing. For a more 
extensive range of quest generation tables, 
refer to Matthew J. Finch’s outstanding 
Tome of Adventure Design, pp.15-25.

HOW DO YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS QUEST? 
The following table can provides more story elemtents for your quest. For example, if a local 
temple gives you the quest, then perhaps it involves some deity that they have an interest in. 
Or, if you roll 65-67: Event sparks a memory, then the nature of this event will determine 
some of the flavour of the quest. Take the required time to figure out what is going on, what 
the quest is, and how it relates to your PC.

WHAT NEXT? 
Afer you have discovered the problem, ask 
questions such as WHAT, WHY, WHEN, 
WHERE, HOW and WHO.  
All of these questions have answers. You 
can use our included question/answer 
mechanic (Chapter 2) Mythic, or your own 
imagination to come up with the answers.  
 
For example, take the problem “Item Lost.” 
 
WHAT was the item? Was it magical, 
mundane (but special in some way), was it a 
map of an even greater treasure, was it a 
book of spells? 
WHY was it lost? Was it stolen, and if so 
by whom? Or was it lost through stupidity 
or oversight, or did it simply become 
misplaced?  
WHEN was it lost? Recently, or centuries 
ago? 
WHERE is it rumoured to be? Does 
anyone have any idea of its location? How 
is the information to be obtained? 
HOW can it possibly be retrieved? Is the 
place where it is rumoured to be even 
reachable? Or, if the location is not known, 
is there some way of discovering the 
location? 
WHO has alerted you to the item’s 
absence? Is it someone you know, or a local 
in a place you are travelling through? Or is 
it someone whose trustworthiness is 
uncertain? 
 
All of these question can be answered using 
Q/A rolls. 
 
RELEVANCE 
The answers must also fit with your 
current situation. For example, if you are 
out in the middle of a deserted plain, how 
are you going to receive news about a 
kidnapping / hostage situation? 
Reroll, if you need to, in order to obtain a 
quest more relevant to your current 
situation.  
 
GET CREATIVE 
The right hand column of the first table, 
“Resultant Quest” will emerge as the player 
interacts with the elements therein. For 
example, the problem “Invasion” results in 
the Resultant Quest “Repel,” but how to 
repel? If an orc general is marshalling a 
small army to take a village, your quest 
could be to array able villagers against the 
orcs. Or, you might get a bit craftier and 
decide to go straight to the general himself, 
posing as a messenger bringing news of 
richer spoils elsewhere. So, trickery could 
form the basis of your quest instead of 
straight opposition. Or, you could somehow 
divert another group of monsters to cross 
paths with the orcs, and let them kill each 
other off! There are many ways to take the 
adventure beyond the generic.   
 
RENOWN 
After the successful completion of a quest 
that results in the improvement of welfare 
for residents of a village, town or city, or 
other settlement, the PCs might find that 
their renown increases. This could result in 
the ability to succeed in haggling down 
merchants, getting lodgings for free, and 
receiving such boons as free holy water / 
blessings from local temples (interpretable 
as inspiration points) and other things.  
See Chapter 11 for more information on 
Renown.  
 
RUMOURS 
You could also use one of the many 
rumours tables available on DM’s Guild to 
provide you with leads for your quest. Or, 
roll on the Rumours Tables provided in 
Chapter 3 and Chapter 10 of this book.

Chapter 8: 
Random Dungeon 
Generation  
 
Every now and then during a game of 
Dungeons & Dragons, it is necessary to 
enter a dungeon!  When doing this, it is 
nice to be surprised, rather than to know 
what is coming. To this end, a system of 
random dungeon generation is desirable for 
solo play.  
The dungeon generation tables in Dungeon 
Master’s Guide (pp.290-301) are a good way 
to generate dungeons randomly, and 
contain a good level of detail. Have a look 
at those, and if you like, pair the tools there 
with the tools in this chapter. 
It is recommended that you map as you go 
so that you can backtrack if need be. These 
random dungeons can easily turn into 
adventures that you then run for players 
later on, as a DM.  
Another dungeon generation system can be 
found within the pages of the excellent 
Tome of Adventure Design (pp.149-185).  
Below is my own personalised 
dungeon generation tool. Like the 
systems mentioned, it consists of 
a series of tables. One of the 
main differences with this 
system is the inclusion of a 
“Passage Contents Table.” 
The DMG has a room 
contents table (as does 
this chapter) but not a 
passage contents 
table. Isn’t it likely 
that PCs will 
encounter things in 
passages 
sometimes? I 
think so.  
 
A REMINDER 
Just to reiterate a point made earlier, don’t 
feel beholden to these mechanics. You may 
wish to use the tables in this chapter to 
simply provide the basic physical outline of 
your dungeon, and then use Mythic or Q/A 
rolls (see Chapter 2) to fill out the details. 
Or, you could use this generator sometimes, 
and the DMG system at other times.  
Occasionally, you may decide that certain 
things just happen, rather than rolling for 
them. Remember, you are the DM (and 
player), so if something makes sense within 
the context of your adventure, go with it. 
This is a time for you to use your creativity 
to the utmost. The tables and mechanics 
provided herein are simply meant to fire 
your imagination, not provide every single 
last detail of your adventure. In the words 
of the great pirate Hector Barbossa, these 
are more what you’d call “guidelines” than 
actual rules! 
Remember also that things often have a 
reason for being somewhere, so ask those 
questions… What, where, why, 
how, when and who.  
 
A NOTE ON 
ROOM 
CONTENTS 
When determining 
the contents of the 
rooms in your 
dungeon, you could 
use the Dungeon 
Master’s Guide, or 
perhaps Tome of 
Adventure Design by 
Matthew J. Finch, an 
outstanding resource for 
dungeon generation, 
which contains 
numerous tables to dress 
your dungeon (I cannot 
recommend this resource 
enough - worth every 
penny). Also, feel free to spice 
up the dungeon with a bit of 
dungeon dressing. The DMG 
(pp.298-301) has some great 
p g
f Adventure Design (pp.149-185). 
n

on generation tool. Like the

## Page 41

dungeon dressing tables you could use, 
providing furniture, natural features and 
other details. 
Kent David Kelly’s excellent Random 
Dungeon Room Generator, available on 
Dungeon Master’s Guild, is a great tool for 
this also and consists of an excel 
spreadsheet. Every time you hit the 
“calculate” button, it provides you with a 
new room description. A great product and 
very reasonably priced.  
 
ANOTHER APPROACH 
TO DUNGEON 
STOCKING 
Alternatively, you could take a similar 
approach to dungeon encounters as that 
given in Chapter 3, which deals with 
wilderness and urban encounters. That 
system encourages you to make a series of 
d100 rolls to determine how many 
encounters you experience in a given time 
period.   
Chapter 6 contains a list of dungeon 
encounters which you can use to pad out 
your adventure. When you have rolled on 
that table to the point where events are 
repeating, then use the tables in Chapter 14 
to generate your encounters, or switch to 
the Room and Passage Contents Tables, 
found later in this chapter. The question 
then will be where within the dungeon the 
encounters are situated. So, first determine 
the number of encounters based on the 
activeness of the dungeon (on the table to 
follow) If you roll 3 encounters, then every 
time you enter a new space, use a Q/A roll 
to determine if this is the place where you 
have the encounter. Or just decide. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OPTIONAL: TABLE TO 
GENERATE NUMBER OF 
RANDOM DUNGEON 
ENCOUNTERS 
Use the table below to determine how 
many encounters your PC might have 
while moving through the dungeon.  
“Activity” refers to how much activity has 
been taking place within this dungeon  
of late. Your story, or Q/A rolls, will 
provide the answer to that.  
In the column marked “d100 Rolls” is a 
figure. This is how many times to roll a 
d100. For every roll under 25, something 
happens. Refer to Chapter 6: Dungeon 
Encounters, or Chapter 14: Story Element 
Interaction Tables to find out what.

YOUR POOR CLUELESS 
PC 
Sometimes in solo adventuring, it becomes 
necessary for you, the pseudo-DM, to have 
a little more knowledge than your PC, and 
then, knowing the danger they’re in, to roll 
the dice and hope like hell they succeed.  
An example here is traps. Sometimes on the 
tables below, your character will come 
across a trap, but may not initially know it 
is there. You will be required to make a 
perception or investigation or similar roll, 
and just hope for the best!  
Your knowledge and your PC’s knowledge, 
are two different things. I hope that most of

---

## Page 42

the time, you will be able to be immersed 
and right there with your PC, and I’ve tried 
to structure this soloing system in order to 
achieve that. Sometimes, however, there are 
situations when you have to play a kind of 
pseudo-DM role. Just go with it, it’s all part 
of this style of soloing.   
 
CLUES 
You may wonder how it is possible to find 
clues for something which you, as player 
and “pseudo DM”, have no idea about. 
The answer to that is, the clues determine the 
answer. So, even though the clues are 
random, they point towards or foreshadow 
something, and it is your job to find out 
what that is.  
Perhaps the clues relate to something in 
another location outside the dungeon. Let 
Q/A rolls, and your creativity, fill out the 
details and guide what you think is the 
significance of the clues.  
 
NOT ENOUGH 
MONSTERS! 
If you find that this dungeon generator is 
not providing enough combat encounters  
for your taste, do something crazy like 
adding 30 to all your Room and Passage 
Contents rolls. Or, simply use Q/A rolls to 
determine what is in each room, as in Is 
there a monster in this room? That should 
move things along a bit quicker! 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIRST QUESTION: How 
Big Is Your Dungeon? 
Use the table below to determine how 
many rooms are in your dungeon. When 
your dungeon reaches the room amount 
specified, then rooms cease to have extra 
doors and passages tend to dead end. You 
have discovered the limits of your dungeon. 
Time to leave!

BLANKET RULES 
When mapping your dungeon, use the following guidelines from p.290 of the DMG: 
“If a feature would exceed the boundaries of the page, curtail it. A corridor might turn or come to a 
dead end at the maps edge, or you can make a chamber smaller to fit the available space. Alternatively, 
you can decide that passages leading off the edge of the map are additional dungeon entrances. Stairs, 
shafts, and other features that would normally lead to levels you don’t plan to map can serve a similar 
purpose.  
The existence of stairs presumes a dungeon with more than one level. If you don’t want a multilevel 
dungeon, reroll this result, use the stairs as an alternative entrance, or replace them with another 
feature of your choice.”

ROOM CONTENTS  
At this stage, it might be a good idea to access the room description and contents tables on 
DMG pp.293-296. These provide flavour by dungeon type (i.e.: lair, tomb, stronghold, 
temple) and give info on room types and current state. Or, you can simply roll on the table 
below and adjust the room type to fit the contents determined by the table.  
Optional Modifier for Room Contents table based on room size:  
Large-sized room: +15  
Huge-sized room: +30  
 
NOTE: Some of these results require you to make a series of d100 rolls to determine 
additional content. You will then proceed to their appropriate tables in order to further 
determine additional items.

CHAPTER 9: RANDOM 
WILDERNESS 
GENERATION 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Included in this chapter is an expanded 
version of the rules given in Chapter 3: 
Travelling. This system is more useful for 
quest-based play and wilderness-based 
quests, where your PC or PCs are 
travelling across wilderness to explore a 
certain area, perhaps following up on 
rumours about activity in that area.  
Similar to how you might randomly 
generate a dungeon with the tools in 
Chapter 8: Random Dungeon Generation, the 
system contained in this chapter generates 
random terrain and wilderness features. 
This system can be used whenever you are 
adventuring through and exploring 
wilderness without knowing exactly what 
is within that territory. You can use this 
when travelling between settlements if you 
like, or you can use the more stripped-down 
travelling rules given in Chapter 3.  
 
 
Large-scale map of part of the author’s homebrew world, the Voldrelm. 
 
 
GEOGRAPHICAL 
FEATURES 
Looking at a large-scale map of the 
Forgotten Realms (or any realm), we can 
see that the topography is mapped in a very 
general way. But this is not always how we 
encounter it in reality. A 30-mile area (one 
day’s travel) that appears forested can 
contain other features also. 30 miles is 
actually a pretty long distance, and within 
that space you will undoubtedly find many 
microcosms and smaller environs.   
 
USING THE TABLES 
First, determine what sort of general 
terrain you are travelling through. We call 
this the overarching terrain. This is the 
dominant terrain in this area, but as 
mentioned above, within those areas will be 
smaller environs. Example - a forest will 
contain clearings, maybe some hills jutting

---

## Page 58

out of it, an unmarked settlement or two, 
some monuments. We call these minor 
features. 
Once you know the nature of the 
overarching terrain, go to the appropriate 
table for that terrain type. For every five 
miles of travel (or less, if you wish - this 
number was invented because some players 
find repeated rolling tedious), roll once on 
this table. It is entirely likely that you will 
get something in the range of 1-50 or 
thereabouts, which will result in the 
continuation of the overarching terrain. 
However, numbers higher than this may 
result in a minor feature. Examples of minor 
features are small woods, hills, monuments, 
unmarked settlements and the like.  
Once you have determined what minor 
feature is present, you can move to the 
corresponding minor feature table to find out 
exactly what sort of small wood, 
monument, unmarked settlement (or 
whatever) it is you have found.  
When rolling for encounters in these areas 
(Chapter 16), use the minor feature as the 
terrain type. If you are in a small wood, for 
example, and encounter a monster, use the 
forest encounter tables in Chapter 16. 
You may wish to map as you go so that you 
can explore further on the return journey! 
 
A NOTE ON 
PERCENTAGES 
Where you see a note such as “Inhabitants 
are 70% human,” that does not mean that 
the demographic is 70% human. Whenever 
you see a percentage value, that is a 
direction to make a d100 roll. On a roll of 
(in this example) 70 or less, that means that 
the inhabitants will be human (mostly). If it 
is over 70, it means the dominant race will 
be gnomes, or gnolls, or halflings, or 
giants, or something else (answers to be 
determined by Q/A rolls).  
 
 
 
 
 
GOING AROUND 
Of course, unlike a dungeon where you are 
hemmed in by walls, you can go around 
things in the wilderness. So an encamped 
army of orcs isn’t necessarily something 
you need to encounter, as long as you 
stealth past it, or give it a really wide berth. 
You may even give it such a wide berth 
that you encounter a whole different minor 
feature. Use the appropriate skill checks 
and Q/A rolls to figure out the results of 
your chosen course of action.  
 
ACTIVE AREAS 
You could be travelling towards this area in 
order to reach a place where activity has 
been rumoured to be taking place. For 
example, strange lights have been reported 
in the area, or savage beasts have been 
mauling livestock and are rumoured to be 
lurking here.  
When you reach such Active Areas, roll on 
the Active Areas Table to determine what 
you find.   
 
A REMINDER 
I’ll say it one more time. The mechanics 
herein are simply meant as triggers for 
your imagination and creativity. I’d like to 
think that you are using Mythic or the Q/A 
formula from Chapter 2 to add detail rather 
than relying on the tables all the time, 
which only provide a certain level of detail. 
Things change from context to context, 
and also within the larger framework of 
your campaign story. If a particular roll 
doesn’t make sense or doesn’t seem exciting 
or cool enough for you, then simply adapt 
what is written to make it work for your 
story... or roll again! Or, decide that 
something else happens, player’s choice.  
By all means, keep using the awesome 
websites and generators and random 
encounter tables you’ve been using already 
for your personal style of solo play. Just 
add this book to those tools. Solo 
adventuring is much more fun when it’s 
loose, freeform, creative, just like any group 
game of D&D. Make it fun for yourself. It’s 
D&D, not reality. It’s an escapist art form,

This area contains more proof of the rumours / leads you are investigating. Roll 
once on Clue Table (this chapter), or on Chapter 14 tables, then roll again on this

You find the beast / monster / cause of the problem you have been looking for. 
Roll d6. 1-3: Medium Encounter. 4-5: Hard Encounter. 6: Deadly Encounter. (Use 
Chapter 16). 50% chance you haven’t been noticed. On a successful stealth roll 
(DC=Creature’s passive perception), attack with surprise.  
54-80 
You find the beast / monster / cause of the problem you have been looking for, 
and an associated structure or dwelling, such as a lair or ruins that they inhabit.

## Page 76

(You could go to Chapter 8: Dungeon Generation from here) When you find them, 
roll d6. 1-3: Medium Encounter. 4-5: Hard Encounter. 6: Deadly Encounter. (Use 
Chapter 16). 
81-82 
You find a lair or dwelling, but it appears currently uninhabited. Perhaps the 
creature you seek is away causing mischief right now! 
83-84 
Stealth check from all your PCs. If one check is lower than 14, then the creature 
has noticed your PCs’ arrival and is stalking them, preparing an attack. They will 
probably be surprised! 
85-86 
This area is not what it was rumoured to be. Make a d100 rolls. If it is 25 or 
below, roll on the Wilderness Encounter Table. After resolving the encounter, 
continue exploring the area and make an investigation check, DC 15. If successful, 
roll again on this table. If unsuccessful, make another d100 roll (as above)   
87-88 
You find another party of adventurers investigating the same rumours / leads you 
are investigating. They are (d4) 1: Hostile, 2-4: Friendly. There are 1d4 members 
in the party. Roll on NPC tables (skip professions and roll on class tables instead) 
to determine who they are, then roll again on this table.   
89-90 
You find a dead party of 1d4 adventurers (use NPC tables if you wish). They have 
been hacked / maimed savagely, and it appears all their weapons and belongings 
have been stolen.  
91-92 
You find a dead party of 1d4 adventurers (use NPC tables if you wish). 
93-94 
You meet an NPC, who gives you details of another, far more important quest 
related to this one. Go to Chapter 7: Quest Generation to find out what it is.   
95-96 
You discover that the creature or target you seek has discovered that something is 
tracking them, and has departed the area. You could pursue (further rolls on 
Wilderness generation tables, above), or you could declare the matter solved (10% 
chance they return once you are gone).  
97-98 
A mysterious NPC, a lone adventurer, is present here, and has resolved the issue. 
They give proof too (carcass / spoils of completed quest). They tell you that you 
may claim the fame of completing this, as long as you accompany them.  
99 
The target or creature you already seek is dead (possibly by another party of 
adventurers, who you may meet nearby), but on investigation you discover that 
the creature did not deserve to die and were probably innocent or were just 
minding their own business. Whoever gave you these rumours or set you on this 
quest is either deluded, or else deliberately deceiving you for some reason.  
100 
The rumour turns out to be some sort of devious trap to lure your PCs into an 
ambush! Level appropriate deadly encounter.

CHAPTER 10 
MERCHANTS & 
SHOPPING 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The tables included herein are designed to 
help you determine whether you can find 
certain kinds of merchants within the 
settlement you are currently visiting. First, 
decide what merchant you are looking for, 
and then on the table below locate the DC 
for the existence of such a merchant in your 
current town.  
Sometimes the setting information 
available for a particular town will state 
that certain merchants are noted as being 
present in that town. In this case, you may 
ignore rolling for those merchants and 
simply make rolls based on finding specific 
items (see below). 
If trying to find a specialised type of 
business/institution (e.g. gold finesmith), 
you may need to make some additional 
Q/A rolls to see if you can locate that 
business.  
If you find the merchant you are looking 
for, you may (if you wish) roll on the 
second table to determine the quality of 
that merchant.  
If you cannot find the exact type of 
merchant you are looking for, then find an 
equivalent / similar type of merchant on 
the list below. Make a d20 roll (unmodified) 
to determine whether they exist or not. 
This is not a skill check, simply a roll to 
check for the occurrence of a merchant, 
based on the size of the settlement you are 
currently in.

ITEMS 
Once you have found the merchant you are 
looking for, and determined their quality, 
you need to determine whether they 
possess the item you require. For this, it is 
required that you make a judgement as to 
the rarity of the item you seek. For 
example, plate armour would be considered 
common for an armourer, but gnome-sized 
plate armour would definitely be considered 
uncommon, perhaps even rare. Legendary 
items would include one-of-a-kind type 
products, for example mithral swords or 
other such specialty items. For prices, 
consult the equipment list you are basing 
your search on. Persuasion rolls might 
enable you to bring the price down by as 
much as 20%, based on the disposition of 
the merchant (you could use NPC tables to 
determine this).  
Roll separately for each item you seek. The 
roll is a straight D20, no modifier.

Consult DMG, p.113, to create a name for your tavern (or consult the slightly racier one 
below, eh, nudge nudge), then roll on the table after this one to find out what sort of

CHAPTER 11 
DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES 
 
INTRODUCTION 
My idea is that this chapter will grow 
through repeated revisions of this book. 
Initially, it might be a bit scant, but I at 
least want to give a basic outline of the 
ways in which we can manage and interpret 
downtime activities for our solo PC or PCs. 
This is not pretending to be a 
comprehensive overview of downtime 
activities, merely a collection/overview of 
the different resources in one place, with a 
few small ideas added. 
Below is a table that attempts to organize 
different downtime activities by the time 
taken, results, whether co-operation is 
possible, requirements and references for 
further reading. I’ve given very loose 
guidelines as to how to structure your 
downtime activities, which should enable 
you to make informed decisions about what 
you want your characters to do in their 
downtime. For more information, go to the 
listed references provided for the core 
material.

LIFESTYLE 
The Player’s Handbook, p.157, contains 
guidelines on what it costs to live, day to 
day, in your fantasy setting. It offers a 
blanket cost for accommodation, food and 
drink, and all other necessities (and 
occasionally some luxury). Equipment 
maintenance is also factored in. An 
aristocratic lifestyle can cost up to 10 gp a 
day, but such expenditure will keep you 
very well appointed. Perhaps your PC has 
the Noble background and simply must live 
in luxury.  
If your character is accustomed to living an 
opulent lifestyle, then a minimum of 4 gp a 
day will be required to keep them in the 
style to which they have become 
accustomed.  
If your PC is more of a hermit, then 
perhaps they like to live off the land, only 
really using inns and the like when visiting 
settlements. These characters are experts 
at hunting and foraging, making camps and 
other survival techniques, and can survive 
in just about any environment without 
having to pay for it.  
But if you can’t be bothered with such 
considerations, then a modest expenditure 
of 1 gp a day will keep you fed and housed 
(as long as you can locate an inn, that is!) 
 
RENOWN 
REIMAGINED 
The Dungeon Master’s Guide, p.129, 
introduces the concept of renown, mainly 
in reference to military rank. The way I 
have run it in games as a DM is as more of a 
reputation-based score. Here I would like 
to propose a reimagining of the renown 
stat, with two distinct categories: local 
renown, and realm renown.  
These scores are gained through 
successful transactions and other dealings 
with the public. But what can they be used 
for? In this version of renown, the stat is 
used to reduce the DC of skill checks 
required to investigate for buyers, 
negotiate prices, persuade workers to take 
a contract, any number of things that require 
charisma (and sometimes intelligence) as a base 
skill.  The general rule is that every renown 
point enables you to reduce the DC by 1. 
The ways in which renown can be used are 
listed in the main table, above. 
Below is a list of ways that renown can be 
gained.  
Local & Realm renown: Local renown 
refers to renown that you have in a 
particular settlement, and you will have 
different renown scores for different 
settlements (Example: your Waterdeep 
renown score might be 2, but when you 
arrive in Loudwater you would start from 0 
again). Everyone starts at 0 renown unless 
you have accumulated some realm renown. 
Each realm renown point you have 
accumulated is a point above 0 at which you 
start in every settlement. For every 3 new 
local renown you accumulate, you gain 
1 realm renown. (Note: Realm renown used 
to start above 0 in a new settlement cannot 
be used to gain more realm renown).

If there is an activity you would like to 
perform not listed here, that you think 
would gain you local renown, then come up 
with an appropriate score yourself, using 
the above as a general guide.  
 
CONTACTS 
The other concept I would like to introduce 
here is the idea of contacts. After successful 
transactions with a professional, make a 
charisma check (DC=their wisdom).  If 
successful, you gain them as a contact and 
may add them to your contact list. An 
example contact list might be as follows: 
 
Contact 
How known 
Terrol  
Blacksmith (crafted a greataxe for me) 
Kulos 
Fennishaw 
Purchased a Helm of Comprehending 
Languages from me 
Salena 
Loress 
(Druid) 
Taught me the formula for making 
healing potions 
 
Contacts can be used for expediting future 
transactions. You can possibly use them 
repeatedly as buyers or suppliers of 
material or manpower for future 
transactions, for example giving them first 
right of refusal on the sale of items. Or they 
could become useful sources of information, 
even quest givers. You may have multiple 
contacts in multiple settlements. Contacts 
can also include NPC adventurers who can 
accompany you on quests. 
 
CRAFTING MAGIC 
ITEMS 
Now this is interesting. Xanathar’s Guide 
To Everything states that most magic items 
require exotic items to craft, often 
requiring travel. You could theoretically 
base your whole solo campaign around 
your travel to various lands to collect 
materials for crafting magic items.

SKILL TRAINING - 
Costs and Process 
Before learning a skill, one must find 
someone who can train you in this skill. For 
this purpose, use the table in Chapter 10 
that lists the different DCs for finding 
particular merchants in a settlement, based 
on the size of that settlement. It is the first 
table in that chapter.  
Find the merchant that is closest to the 
skill you want to learn (eg - if you want to 
learn how to use smith’s tools, use the DC 
for finding a blacksmith). Then, follow the 
guidelines given in the core rulebooks.  
 
LEARNING CORE 
SKILLS / WEAPON 
SKILLS 
Really, learning things like survival or 
stealth, and becoming proficient in those, as 
well as learning weapon feats like crossbow 
expert, can really only come through 
levelling. As such, the core rules state that 
you may take these feats (as given in the 
PHB) whenever you are instructed to 
increase an ability score (eg at Level 4). 
You may, instead of increasing an ability, 
take a feat instead, but you may wish to 
roleplay the finding of an expert in this. See 
PHB (pp165-170) for more details. 
 
NEW DOWNTIME 
ACTIVITY: ANIMAL 
TRAINING 
Animals can be trained for a variety of 
different purposes. Falconry is an obvious 
example, as well as perhaps training a wolf 
to perform basic tasks like scouting ahead. 
These creature companions can then be 
taken on journeys and used to accentuate 
wilderness travel and for any other purpose 
you care to think of.  
First, one must actually acquire an animal, 
and the best place to do this is in the wild. 
Wild creatures are healthier and in better 
condition than pre-captured animals. 
Perhaps you have an encounter with a beast 
that you could see being useful. If you 
cannot find one in the wild (either by an 
investigation check,or by coming across 
one at random), then you may decide to 
purchase one. This beast may already be 
tamed, but not trained.  
Step 1: Capture and pacify the animal 
This is ideally done using non-violent, non-
traumatising methods. A strength check 
and an animal handling check might be 
required here, as well as a charisma check.  
Step 2: Tame the animal.  
A significant amount of time must be spent, 
daily, in acquainting the creature with your 
presence and getting it used to you. Spend 
a minimum of two hours per day with the 
creature, and make an animal handling 
check. This is ideally done during 
downtime. Once you manage to do this 
successfully over three days, the animal is 
tamed and you can begin to train it.  
Step 3: Train the animal.  
For this, you will need the help of a trainer. 
The DC for finding an animal trainer is 
based on settlement size. Once you have 
secured a trainer, you will work with them 
to teach the animal to respond to basic 
commands given by you. This will take one 
month. Make three animal handling checks, 
with a DC of 2d10+5 (calculate DC 
separately for each check). Each check 
covers 10 days. Count how many total 
checks it takes to reach three successful 
checks, and multiply the result by 75. This 
figure represents how much gp you will 
need to pay the trainer as their fee.

NEW DOWNTIME 
ACTIVITY: HOSTING 
BANQUETS AND 
TOURNAMENTS 
Once you possess a residence (preferably a 
large one) you can host events, thereby 
gaining renown. Providing such 
entertainment is obviously going to cost 
you a lot of money, but could gain you 
valuable contacts and gain you renown into 
the bargain.  
Requirements: A large estate, regular- or 
large-sized castle or keep. Money to pay 
serving and cooking staff, as well as 
warriors and other entertainers.

CHAPTER 12 
ROLEPLAY IN THE 
SOLO FORMAT 
 
The one element that many players have 
said is missing from solo gaming is the 
element of roleplay. This is just part and 
parcel of the format. How do you roleplay 
with a bunch of mechanics? The simple 
answer is, you don’t. 
In the introduction to one of my 
gamebooks, I proposed the concept that 
roleplay in the solo format consisted of 
playing your PC true to form, and making 
decisions based on their ideals. 
With this supplement, I had the idea of 
going one step further and creating a 
system to generate possible routes that 
interactions with NPCs could take. This 
chapter is something of an experiment - 
you may find it useful, you may not. As this 
is a living document, it is expected that this 
chapter will develop more in further 
iterations of this document. 
Follow the procedure below to determine 
how people react to situations brought 
about / opinions offered / actions 
performed by your PC.  
You may determine this by other means, 
such as a question/answer roll. This is just 
to be considered as another tool available to 
you in your solo play. 
 
AGREEING  
This system of solo roleplay that I’ve 
created is structured around rolls to 
determine the outcome of interactions. 
Your PC is trying to get whoever they are 
interacting with to agree with them. In the 
context of this system, agreeing means one 
of the following things.  
 
• 
Concurring with their opinion. 
• 
Going along with a course of action 
they are suggesting.    
• 
Bending to their will.  
• 
Providing details or information 
requested by the PC.  
 
Friend or Foe? 
First, the NPCs relationship to the players 
must be established.  
Are they:  
• 
Foe 
• 
Neutral 
• 
Friend 
• 
Unknown.  
 
A Q/A roll can determine this. If two 
hobgoblins, armed to the teeth, step out on 
the road, and the player asks, “Are they 
friends?” the modifier will be “Highly 
unlikely” (-4). Or, you may just decide they 
attack because it fits with the narrative.  
Obviously, this goes a long way towards 
dictating how interactions with them 
develop.  
 
CHARISMA AND 
EMOTION MODIFIERS 
You will make a question/answer roll using 
two modifiers.  
1. Your charisma  / intimidation / 
deception / persuasion / 
performance modifier. 
2. An emotional modifier for the NPC 
(table below)  
 
EMOTIONS 
The NPC’s dominant emotion must be 
determined. This may already be evident 
from events leading up to this point. If not, 
use the table below.  
Even if you know the NPC’s emotion, find 
it (or its equivalent) on the table below. 
The negative or positive modifier will play 
a part in determining their reaction.  
 
PERSPECTIVE 
The emotions listed below are all about 
perspective. The negative emotions (in the 
lower number range) are considered to be 
negative emotions directed towards your 
PC. Likewise with the positive emotions (in 
the upper number range). If a character 
possesses one of these positive emotions,

---

## Page 96

then they are more likely to agree with the 
PC, and this is reflected in the modifier. 
To give an example, say an NPC is 
“Vengeful.” This description is appropriate 
if the PC has wronged the NPC in some 
way, or if the NPC thinks this is the case. If 
the NPC is “Vengeful” towards a group of 
orcs who raided his farm, then its 
equivalent emotion in the positive range 
needs to be found. 
In this case, “Determined” is probably a 
good alternative.  
 
CONTEXT 
If the emotional modifier doesn’t seem 
correct to you in terms of whether or not 
the NPC is willing to agree, then adjust it 
appropriately. These are guidelines, not 
ironclad rules.  
 
 
 
PROCEDURE: 
To determine whether an NPC agrees with 
your PC, find the NPC’s emotion beneath, 
and the modifier for that emotion. Add your 
PC’s charisma  / intimidation / deception / 
persuasion / performance modifier 
(dependent on the situation). 
Now, taking both those modifiers into 
account, make a Q/A roll. There is no need 
to add the likelihood modifier. The emotion 
and charisma modifiers determine the 
likelihood of the outcome.

CHAPTER 13 
NPC GENERATOR 
In your journeys through wilderness or 
settlements, you will encounter all manner 
of folk. Below is a selection of tables for 
determining who they are! You may prefer 
to use another NPC generation tool. There 
are literally dozens out there. You may 
already have an idea for who you are 
meeting, or you may know some details but 
not others. Use the tables to fill out 
whatever you don’t already know. 
Again, the below list is certainly not 
exhaustive, and you may decide that the 
result of your first roll is not appropriate, 
so feel free to roll again.  
 
Roll on the selection of tables below to 
generate your NPC.

NAME: 
Coming up with a name is a different thing 
entirely.  
Cast your eye about the area you are sitting 
in. Select an object and rearrange the 
letters to form a fantasy name, perhaps 
changing a few letters to get the name to 
your liking. 
Or, think of a friend’s name and do the 
same. 
Alternately, find a fantasy name generator 
and use that.  
 
PREMADE NPCs 
If you can’t be bothered with the process of 
creating an NPC, use one of the  many 
premade NPC resources available on DMs 
Guild, for example Friends & Foes I by 
Andrew Cawood.

CHAPTER 14 
Story Element 
Interaction Tables 
(Random 
Encounters) 
 
The tables included in this chapter are 
designed to provide an infinite number of 
random encounters. I wanted to get beyond 
just an assortment of d100 tables, towards a 
system that had infinite usability. Some 
may think the way I’ve arranged this 
system a tad random, and may want to use 
their own system, which is absolutely fine. 
What I’ve tried to do here is set up some 
factors that can interact to produce some 
interesting and out of the ordinary results. 
If you wish, you can always go and use one 
of the premade encounters in Chapters 4, 5 
or 6. The tables here are likely to produce 
more dramatic results! 
They can also be used to answer questions, 
in place of the question/answer mechanic. 
If you cannot think of a yes/no question, 
simply roll on the Situations (Verbs) list 
below. There are 499 possible single word 
answers, all of which can be interpreted 
loosely to give you an answer to just about 
any question.  
There are many random encounter tables 
available on DMs Guild, so feel free to use 
such products in place of this chapter.  
 
ENVIRONMENTAL RELEVANCE 
Relevance is a factor here. Tailor your 
generated elements towards your current 
environment and context, whether it be 
wilderness, urban or dungeon.

People (NPC table -

13-20 
Situations (Verb List) 
 
Roll initially 4 times to try and generate 
the seeds of your encounter. If this doesn’t 
provide anything useful, keep the words 
you have and continue to roll until 
something presents itself, as many times as 
you need to, in order to generate something 
interesting.  
For example, rolls of 1, 5, 5, 17 results in 
two rolls on PEOPLE and one roll each on 
EVENTS and SITUATIONS. Roll on 
those tables to see what you get, then use 
the question/answer mechanic to provide 
further details.  
As you can see, the scope here is endless. 
An example roll:  
7, 13, 18, 20. 
 
NPCs (Chapter 13): Human Wizard 
Situations (verbs): Enjoy, pry, explode. 
 
By linking the above seeds, I came up with 
an encounter where a wizard, carrying a 
satchel of potions down the road, has the 
bag ripped open by some mischievous kids. 
Potions spill out the road and explode, 
much to the children’s delight, and all 
manner of magical chaos ensues!

SITUATIONS TABLE (VERB LIST) 
What follows is a list of 499 verbs that are meant to suggest situations that could come 
about between elements such as people, creatures etc. Interpret loosely, there is no 
need to stick to these words in a literal sense. Remember that they are verbs, so they suggest 
action. You could also frame a question, and then roll to get a word that might suggest an 
answer. The list is so broad that it can be used to give an answer to nearly any question.  
Roll as many times as you need to, in order to generate something interesting that your PC 
can interact with.  
HOW TO ROLL ON THE SITUATIONS TABLE. 
STEP 1: Roll a d10 to determine your hundreds.  
d10 Hundreds Range 
1-2 
0-99 
3-4

Chapter 15: What Do 
The Monsters Do? 
(Monster Tactics) 
 
One problem we frequently run into while 
solo adventuring is sameness of combat. 
Because we don’t have a DM controlling 
monster movements, combat can tend to 
devolve into a “stand adjacent and bash 
each other” style.  
This is something I’m constantly trying to 
address. Below you’ll find a table that 
attempts to get the monsters moving 
around a little. These tables are somewhat 
experimental and will be inappropriate in 
some encounters. Use these tables if you 
wish, or completely ignore them and decide 
the circumstances of combat yourself. Like 
everything else in this book, this is a tool 
which you can use or not use, depending on 
your playing style.  
Also, take into account that just because 
you come across a monster, that does not 
necessarily mean that combat will take 
place. What are the monster’s intentions? 
Perhaps it just doesn’t feel like fighting 
right now! Or perhaps its intention is to 
catch you and keep you alive for some other 
purpose. 
So, a monster always has a reason to attack 
(or not attack), whether it be instinct, 
defending their territory, or cowardice. You 
may have elements of your story that have 
already determined the monster’s intention, 
or you may not wish to use the below table 
at all. But rolling on this table can provide 
a random monster encounter with the 
element of motivation, which can add to 
your story.  
 
MONSTER FEATS 
If monsters have a feat which is 
characteristic of their attack style, then 
they will generally use it whenever they get 
a chance. For example, take the Aurochs, a 
CR 2 oxen-like creature from Volo’s Guide 
to Monsters. It has a feat called Charge which 
enables it to cause extra damage, and knock 
opponents prone if it moves 20 ft towards 
the target and hits with a ram attack. So, 
take it as read that the Charge feat 
constitutes the Aurochs’ main attack, and it 
will use it whenever it can, even if it causes 
an attack of opportunity.  
 
DISTANCE OF 
MONSTER FROM PC or 
PCs 
Ways to determine: 
• 
Roll 1d8. Monster is that many squares 
away. Or roll 1d10. 
• 
d10 x 10 + 20 ft.  
• 
Roll stealth for the creature. If 
successful, place them 1d4 squares away. 
If stealth check is higher than PC’s 
passive perception, they can make a 
surprise attack.  
• 
Any other method you care to think of.  
 
MONSTER INTENTIONS / TACTICS TABLE 
Add 15 to the roll for BBEGs / Boss Monsters 
d100 
GENERAL TACTICS 
1-4 
Monster flees, scared witless at the sight of you! 
5-9 
Monster is curious and will stay some distance away, checking you out before 
approaching; if a beast, may be open to befriending. Make charisma check with 
advantage. If successful, you could take as companion.  
10-
14 
Monster will stalk you, always staying well out of range, perhaps waiting for you to 
become wounded or disadvantaged in some way.  
112

## Page 113

15-
19 
Monster will stay at distance and make ranged attacks, picking away at you. If you 
try to come near, it will flee.  
20-
24 
Monster may want you caught and kept alive rather than killed. It will fight you to 
the point of unconsciousness, and then will take you away and attempt to keep you 
alive for some purpose.  
25-
30 
Monster is highly alert and on guard. Any stealth checks to approach it are made at 
disadvantage 
31-
70 
Monster simply attacks, purely out of instinct.  
71-
80 
Monster views this area as its territory and you as a challenger. It attacks 
immediately, trying to drive you backward. It might make strength checks to push 
you back.  
81-
90 
Monster has offspring (or something it wants to protect) nearby, and sees you as a 
threat. It attacks immediately, possibly guarding a certain area.  
91-
100 
Monster barrels straight into combat, seeing your presence here as a personal 
affront. It is incited to extreme rage.   
 
MONSTER REACTION TABLE (Round by round) 
At the start of each combat round (or perhaps every second round)  roll for the monster’s 
reaction. If there are multiple monsters, you might roll for the first one, and then the others 
(if intelligent enough) will base their attacks on the success or failure of their ally.  
You may also wish to roll separately for each monster. 
Optional: If the reaction directly contradicts the overriding tactics, or the situation in 
general, you may choose to ignore it. Or, perhaps the tide of battle has turned and thus the 
reaction now makes sense.  
Add 10 to the roll for BBEGs / Boss Monsters.

REACTION

01-
04 
If monster has dropped to less than 50% 
hp, it flees (provoking an opportunity 
attack if necessary), taking double 
movement. 
33-
72 
Creature uses its main attack 
05-
08 
If you scored 25% or more of the 
creature’s hp in damage during the last 
round, creature makes a wis check 
(DC=PC's wisdom+intimidation 
modifier). If it fails, it moves away from 
you quickly (taking dash), and provoking 
an opportunity attack if necessary. If it 
succeeds, it attacks normally. 
73-

Roll on Random Combat Event 
Table  
(eg rom my product Slips, Trips 
and Flying Turnips, or any random 
event table).

If it fails, the creature disengages and 
then moves away from the PC up to its 
movement allowance. Otherwise, it 
attacks normally. 
intimidation check against your 
wisdom (as DC). If it succeeds, 
make your next attack at 
disadvantage. If it fails, it goes 
straight into melee brawl. 
13-
16 
Creature makes an attack, then moves 
away, provoking an opportunity attack if 
necessary. 
81-
84 
Monster inspiration: If the 
monster has a feat that needs to 
recharge, it recharges 
automatically without needing to 
make a roll.  
17-
20 
If there is more than one enemy 
attacking the PC, they all attack and 
then move away in different directions. 
PC can only choose one on which to 
make an opportunity attack. 
85-
88 
If your last attack missed, the 
creature feels a swelling of 
courage. It makes a wisdom check 
(DC=PC Charisma). If it succeeds, 
it attacks with advantage. If 
unsuccessful, it attacks as normal. 
21-
24 
If there is more than one enemy 
attacking the PC, one stays in melee and 
attacks, while another stays at ranged or 
disengages  and moves away to make 
ranged attacks (if it has ranged attacks), 
possibly risking an attack of opportunity 
if enemy has hp to spare. Otherwise, it 
stays in melee. If there is only one 
creature, it attacks as normal. 
87-
92 
If the creature won initiative, then 
it was aware of your presence 
(even though it may not have 
appeared to be) and has a surprise 
attack readied. 
25-
28 
If there is more than one enemy 
attacking the PC, they move to flank the 
PC on opposite sides. 
 
93-
96 
Creature makes an intelligence or 
perception check (whichever is 
highest) with the DC being the 
PC’s main combat ability (strength 
or dex). If successful (and if 
appropriate for the monster), it 
discerns information about the 
PC’s combat skill. If it is obviously 
outclassed, it will take the dash 
action to get as far from the PC as 
possible (provoking an opportunity 
attack if necessary). If it is equally 
matched or clearly superior to the 
PC, the PC makes their next attack 
at disadvantage. 
29-
32 
If combat has not yet started, the monster is 
busy with something else and does not 
initially see the PC as a threat. If the PC 
does not attack, they can probably pass 
without any incident. 
97-
100 
Monster roars for help / 
reinforcements, in its own tongue. 
Make a d100 roll. On a roll of 10 
or below, another one of its type 
appears in two rounds. (This only 
happens once)

Chapter 16:  
Monster Encounters 
for the Solo PC 
 
A NOTE ON THE 
TABLES 
These tables are split into two parts: 
Encounter and Monster. First, roll on the 
Encounter Tables (organized by level and 
difficulty) to find out how many of what 
CR monsters you are facing. Then, 
progress to the Monster Tables 
(organized by terrain and CR) to find out 
exactly what beasties you have to battle! 
Note: Not all terrain types have every CR 
provided, especially the more unusual ones 
such as “Coastal” and “Aquatic.” In such a 
case, just go with an encounter for which 
monsters exist in that environment. Also, 
these tables only go up to level 15, and CRs 
up to 7. Balanced encounters for solo PCs 
are lower CR-wise as a monster’s CR is 
based on the assumption that it is facing a 
minimum of four PCs! A small supplement 
will be released in future covering the 
remaining levels.  
The overarching tool is organized so that it 
is easy to add more monsters and increase 
the variety of monsters you might 
encounter. Simply find the monster’s CR, 
appropriate environment, and then add it to 
the right table.  
Not all of the encounters are exactly to the 
thresholds given on p.82 of the DMG. One 
or two of them might be slightly above or 
below the XP listed there. Keep in mind 
that they scale upwards within the tables 
also. For example, “Level 4 Easy” has an 
XP threshold of 125, but the top roll on 
that table (5-6 on a d6) has a threshold of 
150; a little more difficult.  
For the sake of keeping this book at a 
manageable size, stat blocks are not 
included, but references to find them are.  
Also, when encountering the creature, 
think about how to determine whether your 
PC knows everything about this monster. If 
not, then they will not know about 
resistances, feats, etc, and combat will 
reflect that. This is another of those 
situations where the player potentially 
knows more than the PC.  
 
ADJUSTED FOR THE 
SOLO PC 
All tables listed here have been adjusted for 
1 PC, so there is no need for you to perform 
any complicated equations or anything like 
that. If playing with 2 PCs, refer to the 2 
PC conversion chart below. 
The tables are subtly scaled upwards 
according to difficulty, so the higher you 
roll, the harder the encounter will be, even 
on the “easy” tables. A high roll will result 
in the upper end of “easy.” 
If your PC is finding encounters too hard, 
or too easy (perhaps due to gaining a 
magical item), then you might choose to 
move up or down a difficulty tier to make 
the encounters more appropriate. So, if 
you’re told to encounter a medium monster, 
you might choose to make that a hard 
encounter instead.     
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything also has an 
excellent table entitled “Quick Matchups” 
on p.91 that offers some challenging 
encounters for single PCs of each level. 
Purchasing the core books is a good idea as 
all of them contain valuable resources for 
solo players, as well as upping your general 
player and DM skills.    
 
MULTIPLE MONSTERS 
AND THEIR STORIES 
Here we have another interesting source of 
story generation. If the tables determine 
you meet 2 hobgoblins and 4 monodrones 
in your dungeon, then the question/answer 
mechanic can be employed (probably after 
you have defeated them) to determine how 
this unlikely combination came about. 
Perhaps the hobgoblins have found some 
way of controlling the drones, and are 
using them to attain their goals. As always, 
the Q/A rolls can sub in for just about any 
element in this book. But allow these 
strange combinations to be sources of plot 
hooks and story enrichment.

## Page 116

However, if the combination of monsters is 
completely implausible, you have my 
permission to roll again! 
Another idea: you may choose to randomly 
roll the first monster, and then pick what 
would be a logical partner for it, rather 
than make another random roll.  
Also, the variety of monsters across the 
entire dungeon - how did that assortment 
come to be there? This will further inform 
your story.  
Names of monsters and the monster 
descriptions given in the core material  
provide story elements also. If you are in a 
desert and happen to encounter a Guard 
Drake, the natural question is, what is it 
guarding? Consider these encounters as 
potential story triggers, as well as a chance 
for your PC to bash some skulls! Read the 
monster description and what motivates 
the creature, what its habits are. This will 
suggest other features and creatures that 
might be nearby. Perhaps if you find Rothe 
dwelling deep within some dungeon, then 
some other humanoid - drow or duergar or 
svirfneblin - is there to farm it. Monsters 
don’t just wait around for adventurers like 
you to come blundering into dungeons. 
They have their own agendas and stories.   
 
 
GENERATING A BBEG  
(Big Bad Evil Guy or Boss Monster) 
Sometimes you need to generate a boss 
monster. Follow these guidelines.  
STEP 1: Roll on the table below. 
 
BOSS DIFFICULTY TABLE 
d6 
Difficulty 
1-2 
Medium Encounter 
3-5 
Hard Encounter 
6 
Deadly Encounter 
 
STEP 2: Now go and find the level-
appropriate medium, hard or deadly 
encounter table in the tables below. Choose 
the option you think is most appropriate, 
rather than rolling. Or, use the CR to guide 
your creation of an NPC for your 
adventurers to face off against. It might be 
another case of you (as pseudo-DM) 
knowing more than your PCs. There are a 
number of great NPC /villain resources on 
DM’s Guild, as well as officially released 
stuff like Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes 
which can guide the creation of your villain 
NPCs. Chapter 4 of the DMG also contains 
guidelines for the creation of NPC villains.   
 
DO THEY ATTACK? 
Aside from you attacking them, do the 
monsters you encounter always attack you? 
Perhaps not. Use Q/A rolls, and monster 
descriptions, to determine whether they 
flee, approach curiously, or attack you. You 
could also use the mechanics in Chapter 15: 
What Do The Monsters Do? Don’t presume 
that every encounter will end up in battle. 
And also, remember if the odds are against 
you, fleeing is always an option! Visit 
Chapter 15 for more information on the 
monster’s overall motivation, and round-to-
round behaviour. 
 
FLEEING 
If things turn bad, and the idea of your PCs 
dying is absolutely abhorrent to you (keep 
in mind, it does happen!) then you might 
want to let them flee. An athletics check or 
some sort of ingenious escape or diversion 
might be in order, but keep in mind that 
creature will still be in that place should 
you decide to journey back this way! Or, it 
may decide to pursue.  
 
ANOTHER METHOD 
Of course, if you like your solo play a little 
more unpredictable, you can always simply 
use the question/answer mechanic to 
generate your encounters. Just be careful 
what questions you ask.

INDIVIDUAL TREASURE

The amounts contained in these tables are 
often multiples of 10 or 100. You may 
choose to roll another die on top of that to 
provide a bit more randomness to the 
amount.  
The DMG also has individual treasure 
tables on p.136 which you may prefer to 
use.

TREASURE HOARD 
TABLE 
If you have the DMG, use the Treasure 
Hoard Tables on pp.137-139. If you don’t 
own the DMG, or want to try something 
different, the table below should generate a 
fairly balanced hoard. The numbers here 
are often rounded by 10 or 100. To make 
the amounts more realistic, you could 
decide on a random number that is near to 
the result you obtained. 
How to use: The most important column 
is the one to the far right, containing 
percentile values. Before you roll in a 
column for a particular kind of treasure 
(GP, PP, Gems etc), you need to make a 
d100 roll. If the roll is equal to or lower 
than the given percentage for that row, 
then you may roll for that treasure type.   
M.I. stands for magic items. If you succeed 
in the percentile roll for that column, then 
you may roll for magic items. Example - 
“1d4: D” means that you may make 1d4 
rolls on Magic Item Table D in the 
Dungeon Master’s Guide.  
Gems: “1d4: 10 gp” means you may roll 
1d4 times on the 10 gp gemstone table in 
the DMG. Otherwise, just describe the 
gems as “10 gp gems” on your inventory. 
Note: The table continues on the following 
page.

Chapter 18: Example 
Gameplay Session 
 
EXAMPLE SOLO PLAY SESSION 
If you have never used a style like this to 
generate a solo adventure before, the 
information in this book could all seem a bit 
overwhelming. With this in mind, I’ve 
included below an example session to 
demonstrate how the mechanics included in 
this book could be used.  
The following was generated using the 
quest-based play model (described in Chapter 
1). This style of play involves the players 
receiving quests through a variety of 
sources, perhaps basing themselves in a 
certain area. The quests build on each other 
thematically (if you want) and together 
comprise what you might call a solo 
campaign.  
 
Getting Started 
Obviously, you will need PCs before you 
can do anything! Create a PC (or PCs) at 
whatever level you would like to start 
adventuring at. There are no restrictions 
here. Go wild. If you are playing tabletop, 
perhaps create a physical token or use a 
miniature. If playing virtually, create your 
PC in Roll20 or Fantasy Grounds and 
prepare to get into some serious adventure!  
Just as with a party adventure, create a 
backstory for your characters and equip 
them fully. Flesh them out in great detail. 
Backstory, ideals, bonds, will all add depth 
to your solo campaign.  
I personally like to solo with two PCs. I 
like this because the PCs can interact with 
each other, and the encounters tend to be a 
little more action-packed. Also, it justifies 
the use of death saves.  
The other thing you will need is 
information on your campaign world. Well, 
a little information perhaps, the bare bones. 
For example, what is the name of the town 
or area you are currently in, and what is 
some information that your PCs might 
know about this area? Use DM’s Guild 
resources for info on the Forgotten Realms, 
or if you are soloing through your own 
homebrew world, then all you will need is 
your imagination! Keep track of the info as 
you go, however. You will generate a lot of 
detail for your homebrew world as you 
move through your adventures.  
 
The Quest 
In the quest-based play model, the first step 
is to generate a quest for yourself. The 
alternative to this is to start simply making 
your PCs interact with the local 
environment, which generally leads to 
action eventually. This is called freeform solo 
play and is probably more suited to those 
who have had some experience with solo 
systems such as the Mythic GM Emulator. If 
you are just getting started with solo play, 
then use the quest-based model.  
I start my session with two Level 2 PCs: 
 
• 
Brommar Theldrak, male dwarf 
paladin.  
• 
Rhakhar, male ranger. 
 
Straight away, I am interested in how these 
two came to meet each other, so I’m going 
to make a couple of preliminary Q/A 
(question/answer) rolls to flesh out this bit 
of history. Below is an example of how you 
might frame yes/no questions to get these 
answers. (Details on how to make Q/A 
rolls are found in Chapter 2). 
 
Question/Answer Roll Result Table 
D20 ROLL RESULT 
1-6 
NO 
7-12 
MAYBE 
13-20 
YES 
 
Question: Have Brommar and Rhakhar 
known each other for a long time? 
(Straight d20, no modifier. There’s no 
reason why this would be likely or 
unlikely). 
D20 roll: 2 - No. 
Answer: They just met recently.

---

## Page 158

Question: Did they meet in the town of 
Hourglass (where they are currently 
situated)? 
(Again, straight d20, no mod) 
D20 roll: 9 - Maybe.  
Answer: Since I got maybe, I decide that 
they met somewhere near Hourglass (a 
large town in my homebrew world, the 
Voldrelm). Perhaps they met on the way to 
Hourglass and decided to travel together to 
provide each other company. At other 
times, you might decide that the “maybe” 
result means something different. Perhaps 
“maybe” prompts you to have your 
character make a skill or ability check to 
see if they succeeded in making friends with 
someone, or learning a piece of information, 
and use the outcome of that check to give 
you your yes or no answer.  
 
OK, I think that’s all the info I need on how 
they met. Now to give these two a quest. 
To do this, I proceed to Chapter 7: Quests, 
and How To Generate Them.  
The first table in that chapter is the Quest 
Generation Table. I make a d100 roll on 
that table.  
 
Quest Generation Table 
D100 roll: 23 - Magical Chaos/ Curse.  
Very interesting! But I need more details, 
so I progress to the next table, the Quest 
Source Table, to find out how the PCs 
received this quest. Another d100 roll is 
required (you’ll be making a few of these).  
 
Quest Source Table 
D100 roll: 43 - Treasure map.  
Hmm, ok. A treasure map that reveals a 
magical curse? Well, it’s not too hard to fill 
out the details here. There is treasure to be 
had somewhere, but some sort of magical 
chaos stands in its way. I’ll decide that 
Brommar had the map (he found it on the 
body of a dead orc) , and this is what has 
brought him to Hourglass. When Brommar 
met Rhakhar, he decided it was probably a 
good idea to team up with this human 
ranger, as he could use the help on his 
quest to follow this treasure map! 
 
A little more information on the nature of 
this quest is required, so I head to Chapter 
14: Story Element Interaction Tables.  
I’m going to make a series of rolls on the 
Situations Table. This table, consisting of 
499 verbs, can be used for a variety of 
different purposes, including providing 
detail to any situation. There is a special 
way of rolling on that table which you will 
discover when you use it, but to put it 
simply, it results in a number from 1-499. 
The result of each roll will be a single 
word, which you can interpret however you 
want in the current context. I’m choosing 
to make five rolls. In general, you just keep 
rolling until you feel you have a sufficient 
level of words to prompt the story. 
 
Story Element Interaction Tables 
Roll 1: 222 - Exaggerate 
Roll 2: 371 - Praise 
Roll 3: 336 - Mimic (!) 
Roll 4: 184 - Drop 
Roll 5: 453 - Summon  
 
Interpreting The Rolls 
Ok, interesting results! “Praise” could 
suggest a temple, so I decide that the 
treasure map leads to a temple. “Summon” 
gives me some clues about the “Magical 
Chaos” mentioned earlier. Perhaps some 
dark priest has summoned some 
otherworldly beings to protect the treasure 
he has hidden in the temple, but the 
presence of these beings has upset the 
balance in the area, so that the local town is 
experiencing all sorts of bizarre 
occurrences.  
Sometimes the table produces words that 
work perfectly in a D&D context. When 
you pair the concept of treasure with the 
word “Mimic” that instantly conjures up 
certain images! There could be a mimic in 
here somewhere… perhaps the chest is a 
mimic, or the idol of the god being 
worshipped is a mimic. This might be 
something the PCs discover later. 
However, I know that 2 Level 2 PCs 
against a CR 2 monster is likely to end up 
with me having to roll up new PCs, so 
perhaps I’ll choose not to interpret this in 
158

the way I just discussed! I’ll come back to 
this. 
“Drop” and “Exaggerate” could be 
interpreted a number of ways. Perhaps a 
magic item was dropped and disintegrated, 
and this is what has caused the magical 
chaos. Perhaps the size of the treasure has 
been exaggerated, or you feel the nature of 
the magical chaos has been exaggerated by 
the locals. They’ve definitely heard about it, 
and rumours abound as to what is causing 
it, many of them completely over the top.  
So you can see that using a system like this 
requires you to get fairly creative, using 
your imagination to loosely interpret a 
number of words and situations. Since 
you’re playing the role of DM and player, 
you need to be able to switch between 
wearing those different hats as and when 
necessary.  
The words from the situation table can be 
interpreted a number of different ways, and 
your adventure should provide the context.  
 
Asking More Questions 
More information on the quest can be 
provided through asking the questions 
WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW, WHY, 
AND WHO.  
WHAT - What is the nature of the curse? 
Let’s decide now. A dark cultist or similar 
has his base beneath a temple, where he has 
summoned some sort of being or beings, 
and is causing mischief around Hourglass, 
perhaps using the disturbance to steal 
wealth from local businesses and 
individuals. The presence of the 
otherworldly being has produced an 
unstable magic field which is causing 
bizarre occurrences in the area. Brommar 
knows this due to his possession of the 
treasure map.  
WHEN - When did this happen? Let’s 
make a Q/A roll.  
Question: Did the disturbance happen 
recently?  
d20 Roll: 9 (Maybe).  
From this answer, I deduce that no-one 
really knows when it happened, but the 
effects have only been seen in the past, let’s 
say, year. Long enough for someone to 
make a map detailing where the source of 
the disturbance, and the location of the 
wealth, is alleged to be. 
WHERE - Where does the treasure map 
point to? To establish this, we can use the 
Rumour Location Table, found in Chapter 
3 and Chapter 10. A handy little table for 
establishing locations at random.  
Rumour Location Table 
d12 Roll: 1 - In this settlement / area. 
So, the treasure map points to somewhere 
within Hourglass. We already know it’s in a 
temple, so perhaps this is a cursed temple 
that everyone avoids now. This has 
obviously been a source of trouble for the 
villagers for some time! Our two PCs are 
going to be lauded as heroes if they can 
solve this problem, perhaps gaining some 
renown in the local area.  
HOW - How will they gain access to the 
temple? Well, I’m deciding that it was 
locked, boarded up and barricaded some 
time ago by the priest in charge, with the 
help of the townsfolk. He can let Brommar 
and Rhakhar in, but he will be locking the 
door behind them again. If they are 
successful, they can signal their victory by 
ringing the temple bells.  
WHY - Why did this happen? It sounds 
like its a result of the dark cultist’s 
nefarious schemes. As yet, the PCs don’t 
know.  
WHO - Who caused it to happen? Here we 
could either roll on NPC tables to create a 
villain, or we could just charge in and find 
out who the villain is later. Alternatively, 
we could choose an NPC from a resource 
such as Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes, 
probably making sure they are an 
appropriate challenge for our PCs. Or, we 
could select an appropriate CR monster 
from Monster Manual. In this book, Chapter 
16: Monster Encounters for the Solo PC 
contains a wealth of resources for 
structuring any tier and difficulty 
encounter. For a final battle, you could set 
up a hard or deadly encounter.  
Ok, so, we have the basics of the quest! 
Time to set our PCs loose so they can get 
to the bottom of this mystery.

Quest Underway 
Brommar and Rhakhar set out, making 
their way through the streets of Hourglass.  
This is an ideal time for some urban 
encounters! From Chapter 3, we can use the 
Table to Generate Number of Urban 
Encounters. This is a town, and it is daytime, 
so that means we make 6 d100 rolls every 
12 hours. But it doesn’t take 12 hours to 
get from one side of Hourglass to the other, 
so I decide instead to make 2 d100 rolls. 
Not because it’s chronologically accurate, 
but because there’s more chance of my PCs 
getting an encounter from 2 rolls, rather 
than 1! I’m all about creating action. 
For every d100 roll of 25 or under, we get 
an urban random encounter.  
d100 roll 1: 41 
d100 roll 2: 10 
The second roll triggers a random 
encounter, so we go to Chapter 5: Urban 
Encounters. That’s another d100 roll.  
 
Urban Encounter Table (Chapter 5) 
d100 roll: 5 - A guided tour proceeds past, just 
as the guide drops a particularly tasty snippet of 
local knowledge which the PC was unaware of.  
 
Very interesting! I wonder if the snippet 
has anything to do with the temple we are 
heading to? Time for a Q/A roll. 
Question: Does the snippet of knowledge 
concern the temple we are heading towards? 
d20 roll: 18 (Yes).  
Great, but I need details! Time for some 
rolls on the Situations Table (Chapter 14). 
Roll 1: 272 - Gossip 
Roll 2: 275 - Grieve 
Roll 3: 172 - Displease 
Roll 4: 84 - Bribe 
 
Interpretation 
The rumour goes that the widow of the 
priest who was killed when the temple was 
invaded still grieves to this day. She 
spreads gossip that the temple cannot 
manage its own affairs, and should be 
punished for this state of affairs, and those 
in charge prosecuted. But the priesthood 
has tried to silence her with hush money. It 
seems that they are trying to cover 
something up… 
 
Intriguing. My PCs take this knowledge 
onboard as they make their way towards 
the temple. Perhaps they don’t want that 
priest letting them in after all, he could be 
in on all this. Perhaps they should try to 
find another way in.  
Brommar and Rhakhar reach the temple.  
 
Question: Do they see anyone around 
who looks like they might know 
something? 
d20 roll: 15 (Yes).  
Excellent. But who? Let’s roll on the NPC 
tables (Chapter 13). These tables provide 
all the necessary details to furnish infinite 
NPCs.  
 
NPC Table Results (multiple rolls) 
Race / Gender: Lawful Good Human Male. 
Let’s give him a name: Thane Dornett. (use 
whatever tools you want to name your NPCs) 
Trade: Gravedigger.  
Disposition: Amused.  
Economic Status: Just getting by.  
A local gravedigger knows how to get into 
the temples via the catacombs, as he has 
taken many bodies down there in the past. 
But he finds it hilarious that they want to 
get inside the temple. Are they out of their 
minds? He is giggling a lot, and Brommar 
wonders, is he drunk? (Q/A roll = maybe).  
“There is a drain which connects to the 
catacombs, just over there.” He points to 
the entrance, at the side of the street. 
Brommar and Rhakhar thank the 
gravedigger, and make their way over to 
the drain, which sits outside the temple. 
Lifting the cover off, they lower themselves 
down and find themselves in a passage.  
 
Random Dungeon Generation 
All right, we’re in a dungeon! That didn’t 
take too long, did it? From here, the 
obvious place to go is Chapter 8: Random 
Dungeon Generation. This will map the 
dungeon as you explore it, so you never 
know what is around the next corner.  
160

---

## Page 161

I’ve just decided that beneath the drain 
cover, they find a passage, so I go straight 
to the Passage Table and roll there.  
 
Passage Table 
d20 roll: 3 - Passage goes 30 ft and ends in 
stairs. Go to Stairs Table.  
I map the above out on my flipmat and then 
roll on the Stairs Table. But first, I need to 
find out if there’s anything in the passage, 
so I roll on the Passage Contents Table.  
 
Passage Contents Table 
d100 roll: 54 - Empty.  
Ok. On to the Stairs Table.  
 
Stairs Table 
d20 roll: 16 - Up one level to a room, add 30 
to your Room Contents roll 
Ok, this is interesting. My two PCs go up a 
floor, and then there’s a direction about 
how to roll on a future table. But for now, 
we have arrived in a room, so I need to roll 
on the Room Table.    
 
Room Table 
d20 roll: 7 - Circular, d4 x 10 diameter, d4 
exits 
A circular room, how appropriate for a 
temple. Since we went up a floor, perhaps 
we are now actually within the temple 
itself. I roll a d4 and get 3, multiply that by 
10 for 30 ft diameter, which I draw out on 
the flipmat. I roll a d4 again to get the 
number of exits and get 4, so I map one exit 
to the north, west, east, and there’s already 
the exit to the south through which I 
entered. Time to roll on the Room 
Contents Table, adding 30 to the roll as 
previously instructed.  
 
Room Contents Table 
d100 roll: 12+30=42 - Level appropriate 
Easy Encounter (see Chapter 16). Loot 
20%, SD 10%, Clue 30%. 
And already we have our first encounter, 
after about 10 minutes of solo play. What 
have we found here?  
We need to go to Chapter 16 to find out 
what creature or creatures we have 
encountered, but first let’s look at those 
percentile numbers: Loot 20%, SD 10%, 
Clue 30%. What do those mean? 
What they are is directions to make d100 
rolls. Once the encounter is done, I’ll make 
3 d100 rolls. For loot, if the roll equals or is 
below 20, there is loot in the room 
(probably individual loot, which will be 
based on the creature’s CR). Same deal for 
SD (Secret Door) and Clue. There are 
tables for those too. For Loot, we use the 
loot tables in Chapter 17, or the tables in 
the Dungeon Master’s Guide (p.133 
onwards). 
 
Encounter 
Let’s go to Chapter 16 and work out the 
details of the encounter. It’s an easy 
encounter, but I have 2 PCs, so I need to 
consult the 2 PC Conversion Table. From 
this table I can see that a Level 2 easy 
encounter for my two PCs is equivalent to a 
Level 2 medium encounter for a single PC. 
From here I go back to the start of the 
chapter and find the page containing the 
Level 2 Solo PC Encounter Calculator. I 
roll on the medium table. 
Level 2 Medium. d6 roll: 2 - 2 CR ⅛ 
monsters. 
Now I know the number and CR of the 
monsters I am to face, and the environment 
(hmm… should I use Dungeon, or Urban? 
I’m gonna go with Dungeon), I go further 
on in the chapter to find the CR ⅛ 
Dungeon Creature Table.  
d12 roll: 6 - Monodrone 
All right, so I’m facing off against 2 
Monodrones! Weird, how did they come to 
be here? Perhaps these things are what the 
Cultist is summoning?  
I roll a d8 to determine how many squares 
away the monodrones are. There are a few 
suggested ways to determine monster 
distance suggested in Chapter 15, and this 
is the one I usually use. I roll a 4, so the 
monodrones are 20 ft away. You could also 
roll separately for each creature, especially 
if they are different species.  
Time for combat!

---

## Page 162

Time to kick some monodrone ass! Using 2 d6s as tokens for the monodrones. 
  
Combat 
In Chapter 15 I have provided a couple of 
optional tables and some mechanics (let’s be 
honest - all these systems are optional!) to 
determine how monsters might behave. 
They provide a bit of flavour to basic 
encounters, and can also get monsters 
moving around a bit. First I’m going to roll 
on the Monster Intentions / Overriding 
Tactics Table. 
 
Monster Intentions / Overriding 
Tactics Table 
d100 roll: 74 - Monster views this area as its 
territory and you as a challenger. It attacks 
immediately, trying to drive you backward. It 
might make strength checks to push you back.  
No puny monodrone is gonna push my 
boys back! Although, this tactic roll does 
tell me more about their intention, and 
solidifies the plot point that they were 
placed here as guards. Hmmm… 
Time to roll initiative and get this thing 
done!  
I roll initiative and write the order directly 
on the flipmat, as you can see above. 
Flipmats rule. You can see how these 
things are such great accessories for solo  
 
 
play, they just add another level of 
engagement. 
Straight away, my dwarven paladin 
Brommar moves up and destroys the first 
monodrone with one sweep of his 
greatsword Orenmir. Now it’s the 
remaining monodrone’s turn, and I go to 
the second table in Chapter 15, which is a 
round-by-round monster reaction table. 
Again, you might just ignore this and 
decide what you think the creature would 
do yourself. I like rolling as it adds an air of 
unpredictability.  
 
Monster Reaction Table (round by 
round) 
d100 roll: 59 - Creature uses its main attack. 
This is the most common result from this 
table, with about a 40% chance of occurring 
every round. Other rolls are dependent on 
circumstance. One roll might direct the 
monster to flee if it has lost 50% or more of 
its hp, otherwise it will use its main attack, 
as above. Generally, they attack. 
Occasionally I roll a d4 to determine which 
of my PCs the monster attacks, but in this 
case I decide the monodrone will go for 
Brommar, who is now just two squares 
away, and just killed its ally so it’s pretty 
162

---

## Page 163

brassed off. But against Brommar’s AC 18? 
No chance.  
 
Monodrone attack: 19 + 2 = 21.  
Why you little… 
The modron pokes Brommar with its 
javelin, but then just rolls 1 damage. Puny 
little sucker. Time for Rhakhar to finish 
this! 
Which he does, and combat is done.  
I make a d100 roll to determine if there is 
loot here, as per the earlier direction. It 
comes up at 16… 
 
Loot Roll (30%) 
d100 roll: 16 - Yes. 
Nice. From here I go to the loot tables in 
Chapter 17 and roll on the CR ⅛ Individual 
Treasure Table. 
12 sp, yaayyyy! I make a note of this in my 
inventory, and also give 25 xp to each of 
my PCs. (2 CR ⅛ monsters = 50 xp, 
divided between two PCs).  
 
Is there anything else in the room, I 
wonder. First, I’ll make an investigation 
check for both characters. They both roll 
low, unfortunately, so even if there was 
something to find, they aren’t gonna find it. 
If they rolled a bit higher, I would then 
make a Q/A roll to determine whether 
there was actually anything to find. 
I’ll also make rolls for Secret Door (10%) 
and Clue (30%).  
For the clue roll, I get a 56 on my d100, 
which tells me there are no clues in here. If 
there were, I would go and roll on the Clue 
Table in Chapter 8.  
Onward we go, back to the Passage Table. 
I decide to take the east tunnel. A passage 
contents roll turns up nothing. Journeying 
east, we find a door, smashed, hanging off 
its hinges, and a room beyond. The Room 
Contents roll gives me the following. 
 
Room Contents Table 
d100 roll: 12+30=42 - NPC (enemy or ally 
of the PC) near death (1d4 levels less than you, 
minimum Level 1), unconscious, Level 
appropriate Hard Encounter. Enemy or enemies 
reduced to 50% hp. Loot 50%. A battle has 
obviously gone on here - the NPC has fought a 
powerful creature, and lost, but has damaged it 
somewhat.  
What have we stumbled on here? 
The L2 hard encounter for 2 PCs comes up 
as a Scout, a CR 1 creature. A few rolls on 
the NPC table, and I know that the scout is 
a man. The NPC on the ground is a man 
too, a sorcerer, but is presently 
unconscious.  
Who is the villain here? 
My PCs don’t know, but I as pseudo-DM (I 
use that phrase a fair bit) can ask some 
questions.  
 
Question: Does the scout seem to react 
favourably to our arrival? 
(Straight d20, no modifier. There’s no 
reason why this would be likely or 
unlikely). 
D20 roll: 4 - No. 
Answer: Ok, so Brommar gets a bad feeling 
from this guy. I also decide I’m going to 
roll on the disposition table for this guy, 
and I get 89: Reckless.  
It’s not looking good, and the Scout is 
saying nothing to make us believe he is a 
good guy. Looks like we’re into it again! 
Long story short, Brom and Rhakh make 
short work of the scout (who was at half hp 
anyway) and then revive the sorcerer. 
Turns out his name is Farriss Bokkello, and 
there’s a possibility he might know 
something about the goings-on in here. 
 
Question: Was Farriss a prisoner here? 
d20+2 (likely) roll: 9 + 2 = 11 - Maybe.  
Farris is delirious and we can’t get much 
sense out of him. Perhaps he manages to 
mutter a few words. 
Let’s roll on the Situations Table and see 
exactly what words he mutters! 
 
4 rolls on the Situations Table gives us the 
following words: 
Near - Transform - Wound - Collaborate.  
 
OK, perhaps these aren’t the exact words 
that Farriss says, but this is the general 
gist that Rhakhar and Brommar get. What 
can they interpret from these words?

---

## Page 164

Interpreting the Situation Table 
Words 
The room where the main bad guy is hiding 
out is nearby, and this is where Farriss was 
kept prisoner. He tried to escape but was 
caught and wounded by the scout. Farriss 
did manage to get a couple of hits in 
though. Perhaps now you could help him 
escape? 
Rhakhar tries to ask him if he was held 
prisoner there, but a Q/A roll determines 
that he doesn’t get any sense out of the 
sorcerer, who is in very poor shape.  
Leaving Farriss there, the boys decide to 
search for a secret door back in the main 
room. Q/A says it’s there, and returning 
there, Rhakhar makes a successful 
investigation check and they find it.  
 
Final Encounter 
Right, so I’m thinking that I should 
probably design this encounter. Since the 
scout encounter (which was supposed to be 
“hard”) was a bit of a pushover for my PCs 
(any number of things can skew an 
encounter in a particular direction), I’m 
going to make the next one “deadly”, just 
so I feel justified in gaining a treasure 
hoard.  
Once more, I go to the 2 PC Conversion 
Table, and see that a 2-PC Level 2 deadly 
encounter is equivalent to a single-PC 
Level 3 deadly encounter. Rolling on that 
table, I get the following.  
Level 3 deadly d6 roll: 6 - 1 CR ½ + 1 CR 
¼ + 1 CR 0 monster. 
OK, that sounds pretty deadly all right, 
especially for a couple of Level 2 PCs! But I 
want to make this a proper boss fight, so 
I’m going to choose (rather than roll 
randomly) a nice combo of creatures that 
suit the storyline I’ve developed already.  
 
Dungeon CR ½:  
Skulk 
Dungeon CR ¼:  
Oblex Spawn 
Dungeon CR 0:  
Homunculus 
 
That’s my trio. The Skulk somehow 
managed to summon an Oblex Spawn, 
whose presence here is disturbing the 
natural equilibrium. He also has a 
Homunculus as a minion, and these are the 
three that my guys will find when they 
stumble through the secret door! (They 
learnt that the chamber was behind a secret 
door from the sorcerer Farriss). 
 
But first, is it trapped, and do my PCs 
notice? 
If it’s trapped, then either the Skulk crafted 
the trap, or took advantage of an existing 
trap and decided to use that room as a base. 
I think the second is the more likely 
scenario, as Skulks are more known for 
their cunning than their crafting abilities, 
so I make a Q/A roll.  
 
Question: Is this room trapped? 
d20+4 (highly likely) roll: 12 + 4 = 16 - 
Yes.  
 
Did the skulk take advantage of an 
existing trap? 
d20+4 (highly likely) roll: 19 + 4 = 23 - 
Yes (emphatically). 
 
Skill checks 
But the question is, do my boys think to 
look for it, (perception or insight check) and 
if so, do they notice it? 
It is expected that as you will play, you will 
make skill checks as you see appropriate for 
your PCs. For this purpose, you can use the 
DCs given on p.238 of the DMG as your 
guide. 
 
Difficulty 
DC 
Very Easy 
5 
Easy 
10 
Moderate 
15 
Hard 
20 
Very Hard 
25 
Nearly Impossible 
30 
  
164

---

## Page 165

What is the likelihood they will notice the 
trap? I don’t really know, so in this 
situation I would go with moderate, a pretty 
safe DC for most situations.  
The other option is to return to the 
Random Dungeon Generator (Chapter 8) to 
roll on the Traps Table.  
This generates the basic details of any trap, 
including Trap Type, Notice DC, Save DC 
and Damage.  
I choose the second option, and make four 
rolls on the Trap Table, which generates 
the following trap. 
 
Trap Table Rolls 
Trap Type:  (96) - Trapdoor 
Notice DC:  (27) - DC 11 
Save DC:  
(92) - DC 17 (Yikes!) 
Damage:  
(46) - 2d6 
 
Thankfully, both Brommar and Rhakhar 
make the dexterity save to avoid the 
trapdoor! Now, they stand face to face with 
their adversaries, the cause of all this recent 
chaos in Hourglass! Seeing their three 
enemies, Brommar and Rhakhar must find 
their inner courage - this could very well be 
a fatal encounter if they don’t keep their 
nerve!  
Three d8 rolls (one for each creature) 
establishes the distance of the creatures 
from Brommar and Rhakhar. Then, we roll 
initiative (I choose not to roll on the 
Monster Intentions Table for this 
encounter) and the heat is on! 
 
 
Brommar and Rhakhar vs Skulk, Oblex Spawn 
& Homunculus. 
 
I decide to roll on the Monster Reaction 
table every now and then during this 
encounter. The Oblex Spawn has the first 
attack, and it rolls 14 on the reaction table: 
Creature makes an attack, then moves away, 
provoking an opportunity attack if necessary. 
Rhakhar takes advantage of this and lashes 
out at the spawn, causing 8 hp of damage.  
The skulk then moves on Brommar, and I 
roll on the reaction table, getting 27: If there 
is more than one enemy attacking the PC, they 
move to flank the PC on opposite sides. 
The Skulk moves in and makes its first 
attack on Brommar, reducing him to 5 hp 
on its first attack! Things are looking dire! 
Since the Skulk is invisible, I rule that 
Brommar and Rhakhar will have

---

## Page 166

disadvantage on all their attacks. They are 
hideously underprepared for this encounter. 
Despite Brommar using Lay on Hands on 
himself, he still does not manage to turn 
the tide of battle.  
The battle continues, and the Oblex Spawn 
is defeated, but the Skulk and Homunculus 
are not, and finally, flanking poor 
Brommar, they down him. 
In a last desperate bid, Rhakhar grabs 
Brommar under the arms and drags him 
out (successful athletics check) provoking 
opportunity attacks from both the 
Homunculus and the Skulk, which 
somehow miss… Rhakhar gets Brommar 
out to the adjoining chamber. As this is 
their lair, I decide that the Skulk does not 
follow, and they are able to escape.  
Rhakhar makes a medicine check on 
Brommar, bringing him back from the 
brink.  
Next time, perhaps I’ll think twice before 
setting up a deadly encounter! The 
encounter did what it said on the tin; it was 
definitely deadly for my PCs. If they had 
rolled a little better, and if they didn’t have 
disadvantage, perhaps they might have 
survived, but as it was they were incredibly 
fortunate to escape with their lives. The 
Skulk and the Oblex Spawn that he 
summoned still hold sway in this cursed 
temple! 
Perhaps our two PCs will go and do some 
research so they can find out how to defeat 
this thing, or just use their cunning and 
come up with a way to defeat an invisible 
monster. Or, perhaps they will leave it to 
some more experienced adventurers.  
  
SUMMARY 
So basically, you can see that using this 
system requires you to jump all over the 
place, accessing different tables from 
different chapters when needed. Get 
familiar with the contents menu on the left 
of the pdf. Open it using the bookmarks 
icon. Getting to grips with this will enable 
you to move very quickly between the 
tables and tools you need to access.

Chapter 1-1 
Principles of Solo Adventuring 
 
A couple of years ago I wrote a book aimed at 
people who wanted to play solo Dungeons & 
Dragons, titled The Solo Adventurer’s Toolbox. 
That book, as is stated in the intro, was 
“written with the intention of providing a 
comprehensive method for playing D&D 
without a dungeon master.” Based on the 
testimonials of those who have purchased the 
product through the Dungeon Master’s Guild 
website, it does a fair job of achieving this, 
offering up if not all then most of the tools 
required to run a solo game. 
So, what about this book then? Well, the idea 
with this is to provide a broader experience. 
Within these pages you will find tables and 
tools to provide a more detail-rich game of solo 
D&D. This book simply builds on the first, 
providing more generators, whole new random 
non-combat encounter tables, new systems for 
playing solo, and many other resources.  
Unlike group D&D, there is no accepted “way” 
to do solo adventuring. You discover what 
system works best for you through playing a 
solo game, and then you build on that. Part of 
the beauty of it really… you determine the flow 
of the game based on what appeals to you.  
This book is 5e specific, but can be used as an 
agnostic tool also. If you are familiar with solo 
gaming, it offers some alternate systems to try 
(such as the Battlemap Crawl and Realm Crawl 
systems) and other tools such as a highly-
detailed Urban Settlement generator, Natural 
Cavern generator and Combat Monster AI. 
It is important to note that TSAT1, the first 
Solo Adventurer’s Toolbox, is a completely self-
contained product and can be used on its own 
to conduct solo adventures. Implementing the 
systems in this book will add more complexity, 
but also more richness to your game. There are 
a lot of tables in TSAT2.  
Also note that this book, TSAT2, is a self-
contained solo adventuring resource. You can 
use just this book to run solo adventures as 
well.

Some Principles of Solo 
Adventuring 
• 
The degree to which you invest your 
attention and creativity in the game is the 
degree to which your game will return 
enjoyment to you.  
• 
If you’re having fun, you’re doing it right. 
• 
An oracle is essential. You need a mechanic 
that can answer questions framed in a 
yes/no answer model. 
• 
It’s better for the gaming experience if 
something happens, rather than something 
not happening. If nothing is happening, 
make something happen.  
• 
The more you have to interact with, the 
better. Use multiple resources to generate 
detail. Or, if you’re only using one resource, 
then use your oracle to generate answers to 
the many questions you come up with.  
• 
Anything you can do to speed things up, 
such as using cards (NPC, Monster etc) to 
reduce tabletop clutter, is good and keeps 
immersion high. Rolling damage dice at the 
same time as your d20 attack. Physical 
tokens to represent spell slots that you put 
aside as you use them. Printing out certain 
tables that you’re referring to regularly and 
pinning them somewhere they can always 
be seen.  
• 
Always read monster stat blocks 
thoroughly. When running monsters 
during combat, put yourself in the 
monster’s shoes and imagine what they 
would do, given their motives. Play them 
mean.   
• 
Get your hands on lots of cool tables. I’ve 
tried to provide a good selection in TSAT1 
& TSAT2, but as every DM knows, you can 
never have enough tables. Several of the tables 
in this book reference other products such 
as Tome of Adventure Design and Raging 
Swan’s Dungeon Dressing and Wilderness 
Dressing books. 
• 
Journaling is very useful, especially when it 
comes to recording ideas related to solo 
gaming. The “threads” concept in Mythic 
GM Emulator is ideal for this purpose. 
However, don’t feel like you need to 
document every twist and turn of a  
dungeon. You could, for example, clear a 
dungeon and then write a summary in your 
journal. 
• 
Give your quest some background. It’s not 
just the immediate events that are going 
on, there are other larger events happening 
in your current realm, no doubt, that will 
shape and flavour your quest. Bringing 
such elements into your game can give it 
depth and richness, and help you with 
building your campaign setting.  
• 
Before you begin a solo RPG session, read 
back in your journal to refresh your 
memory about recent events. Reviewing 
your journal and seeing where your 
characters are at, and how far they’ve come, 
is a good way to immerse you in the quest 
before you’ve even rolled a single die! You 
can even rewrite/edit parts of your journal, 
fleshing out events. This helps to 
consolidate your party’s journey so far. 
• 
Get deep into character creation, especially 
background. It’s great for providing 
starting points for quests. Generate your 
first quests using your characters’ 
backgrounds. 
• 
If a particular result that you roll does not 
make sense given the context, roll again. 
• 
Use your imagination. Visualise your 
characters. Put on some inspiring music 
and actively imagine them, what they look 
like, what they sound like, and every other 
trait you can picture. Imagine them 
walking through the world you are 
creating for them, beholding awe-inspiring 
landscapes, imposing fortresses and 
forbidding caverns deep beneath the earth 
where crystals glitter in high rock ceilings. 
Get deep into it. This is another reason to 
move away from computer screens. They 
tend not to encourage things like 
imagination and visualisation.  
• 
A distraction-free space where you can 
game free from intrusion is essential for 
quality RPG experiences of any kind. 
Attempting to sneak a bit of gaming in 
while at work, or trying to do it in a busy 
place, and other such things, are all well 
and good but might provide an inferior 
experience to when you are in your own 
space, with your own resources, and able to 
game without interruption. But obviously, 
you must work with what you’ve got.

Solo Adventuring 
This book is based on the idea of generating the 
story as the characters move through the 
adventure. There are other ways to play solo 
D&D, such as running published modules and 
using specially-written solo adventures. Read 
more about these systems in Methods of Solo 
Adventuring, Chapter 1-2 of this book.  
This book was written as an accompaniment to 
the first volume of The Solo Adventurer’s 
Toolbox and contains a wealth of additional 
material designed to augment what is in that 
book. However, there is also enough 
information within just this book to facilitate an 
immersive solo gaming session. If you are new 
to solo gaming, go and read Chapter 1-8: How 
Do I…? A Reference Table.  
If you’re already well-acquainted with solo 
D&D, then the best thing for you is to freely 
explore the book, skimming through the 
chapters to get an idea of what this contains. 
The chapter titles are designed to be as 
informative as possible and will give you a good 
idea of what to expect. Or perhaps, you’d like to 
read through one of the solo playthroughs in 
the Appendix. 
The table of contents in this document is the 
only section that is hyperlinked. However, 
more useful is the detailed pdf bookmarks / 
contents menu. Find that now, and spend a few 
minutes navigating around the different 
chapters.  
 
Oracles 
An oracle is a dice-driven tool that a solo player 
uses to replace the adjudicating role of the DM. 
Whenever a yes/no answer is needed, an oracle 
can provide it. Solo players get used to 
discerning the various twists and turns of a 
story by posing yes/no questions to an oracle, 
answers to which are furnished with dice rolls. 
A well-constructed oracle system can also 
provide nuance, with caveats to the yes/no 
answers generated, and likelihood modifiers.  
Check out Chapter 1-8 for an oracle that you 
can easily use to run your solo game. This is a 
modified (improved) version of the oracle 
provided in TSAT1 (the first Solo Adventurer’s 
Toolbox).  
There is also an alternate oracle in Chapter 1-8 
which produces random events and combat 
encounters. 
Mythic GM Emulator is another widely-used 
oracle worthy of your attention. 
TSAT1 & TSAT2 
TSAT1 refers to the first volume of The Solo 
Adventurer’s Toolbox. What you’re reading now, 
then, is TSAT2. These abbreviations will be 
used from now on to denote those two volumes. 
 
Keyword Tables 
Keyword tables are collections of random 
words, organized into a rollable table or tables. 
Mythic has an event meaning table, which is a 
combination of 100 adverbs and 100 adjectives. 
It can be very effective.  
TSAT1 provides a list of 400 words, rolled 
with a d4 and a d100. In this book (Chapter 4-4) 
yet another keyword list is provided - an 
additional 800 words. These are not simply 
random words. They are gleaned from huge 
lists of words, and culled to only include the 
more fantasy RPG focused ones.  
You can roll any number of combinations from 
a keyword table. For example, from the current 
book.  
Let’s examine four example keywords. 
 
Undead 
Foliage 
Candidate 
Identity 
 
How would you interpret that combination of 
words? Take thirty seconds and think about it.  
Undead, foliage, candidate, identity.  
Ok, the first three are pretty easy to create a 
story around. Undead are hiding in the trees, or 
maybe if you’re in a dungeon, they’re in a 
chamber concealed with overgrown fungi. Or 
maybe the fungi themselves are undead?  
What about the word candidate? Well, 
obviously that’s you, as a victim of these 
monsters.  Or, if we’re dealing with classic 
undead (a circle of vampires for example) 
perhaps a sacrificial victim is required to unlock 
a rite that dates back millennia.  
Identity? That’s a little harder to crowbar into 
this narrative. You could, of course, just ignore 
this word, or you could push your imagination 
a little further to figure out a way to 
incorporate it. Perhaps, the vampire knows 
your identity. Perhaps even, you yourself… 
With creative thinking, it is possible to quickly 
extrapolate this stuff into quest-level events. 
Use these keywords and oracle rolls as if they 
were ideas occurring to you as a DM during an 
improvised session. Your only limitation is

your creativity. Freeform solo gaming benefits 
from a good imagination, but this is not 
essential as tables can do a lot of this work for 
you. An ability to visualise different situations 
is also helpful. What is essential is a range of 
tools to help you generate adventure elements. 
That’s what this book (and the one before it) 
hopes to provide.  
Sometimes it can be best to let the story itself 
suggest directions. You don’t want to get too 
wild.  
 
ADVANCEMENT 
What system should you follow for advancing 
your solo characters? That’s up to you, and it’s 
the same decision that a DM makes before 
beginning a campaign: XP or milestone? 
I like milestone personally, and I generally 
advance my PCs a level after every major quest 
is completed. Even in my group games, I like 
quite rapid advancement. Every major scenario 
completed is another level. You don’t want to 
make your players work too hard.  
But then, there’s a nice feeling when you win a 
combat encounter and earn XP. If you’re doing 
this, perhaps also consider awarding XP for 
loot gained as well, or adventures completed, 
otherwise advancement could be a little slow.  
Reward yourself well, and often (within 
reason). It keeps you engaged. I’ve started so 
many different solo campaigns since I started 
going down this road of solo D&D. The PCs 
I’m the most invested in are my most recent 
ones, where I’m advancing levels quickly and 
giving them pretty high magic campaigns. 
After all, during solo play, there’s only one 
player to cater to - yourself. Make your 
backstory and the campaign rich and connected 
to your character. That way you’ll be invested, 
and the more things you have to interact with, 
the better.  
 
Level-Appropriate  
You will find the term level-appropriate encounter 
used throughout this book. What this means is 
that if your characters are level 1, you should 
use their level to generate your encounters. 
You might have an idea of what difficulty level 
that encounter needs to be. If not, use this table 
to randomly determine a difficulty level.

Tiers 
You’ll also find the term tier used occasionally 
to calculate certain rolls. You might see the 
direction, roll (tier) d4. This means that you 
take your character’s tier and roll that many d4. 
Consult the table below to discover your tier.

Skill Challenges & 
Setting DCs 
The question of skill challenges often arises in 
solo gameplay. How to handle them? How to 
set DCs and the like? The Dungeon Master’s 
Guide provides the following table for guidance. 
In a solo game, can you discern how hard a 
particular challenge is? For example, how hard 
is it to decipher the cipher to open an ancient 
sealed door when there is masonry falling down 
all around you, and a pitched battle raging 
nearby?

Another approach, however, suggested by a 
member of the Dungeons & Dragons Solo 
Adventures Facebook page, James Aeryksson, 
goes as follows: have your character make the 
necessary skill check, and use the result of that 
to set a likelihood modifier for an oracle 
question. Use the table below for guidance. 
 
Skill check result / Likelihood 
modifier converter table 
Skill check result

17-19 
Highly Likely

A certainty

Example: A rogue is trying to disarm a trap 
with thieves’ tools, with which they have 
proficiency. But there is no way of knowing 
how difficult the trap is to disarm, as there is no 
DM to decide this (unless you set the DC 
yourself).  
They make the thieves’ tools check, which 
turns out as an 18. This produces a likelihood 
modifier of highly likely, which they then use to 
ask the following oracle question. 
Oracle: Can my rogue disarm the trap? (Highly 
likely +5): d20+5=8: No! That must have been 
one hell of a trap.  
Obviously, this is a unique approach and not for 
everyone, but it does increase the 
unpredictability of the game, which is always 
interesting. 
 
Not Too Prescriptive 
Part of the beauty of solo adventuring is its 
freeform nature, and solo play does rely on the 
player being open, creative, and willing to make 
judgment calls on things. Even in the crawl 
systems I’ve provided here (Chapters 1-5 and 1-
6) it’s not designed to be completely rigid. 
Perhaps it’s not necessary to find a rule set to 
cover everything. unless that’s your thing in 
which case absolutely do so. Perhaps tracking 
of resources and that level of play appeals to 
you. Get whatever it is you want out of your 
solo game.  
So, if for example you are exploring a city 
according to the rules in Chapter 2-1, and you 
want to find out how many merchants are in 
each city block, perhaps just decide that there’s 
fifteen merchants. Or roll a d20. Or create your 
own rule!  
There is no way that a solo system can possibly 
account for every single decision that a DM 
might make while running a session. Such a 
book would never get written, as there are just 
too many variables to cover! So, be prepared to 
make some on-the-fly decisions. 
 
Cover: Jeremy Adams 
The inspiration for the cover image comes from 
a location within the adventure Lost Laboratory 
of Kwalish, which I ran as DM for my regular 
Thursday night group: The Monastery of the 
Distressed Body. The party had the idea of 
turning it into a personal stronghold. That led 
to me imagining a solo adventurer arriving at a 
floating city, and overlooking it, wondering 
what adventures it held...

Chapter 1-2 
Methods of Solo Adventuring 
 
If you are just embarking on the solo D&D 
journey, you may be wondering where to start. 
On the other hand, perhaps you have been 
indulging in solo gameplay for a while and are 
aware of a few different methods. Whatever 
point you’re starting from, this chapter should 
provide you with a few ideas about different 
methods and options for indulging your hobby.  
 
Gamebook Method 
A popular method of solo adventuring is to take 
advantage of the gamebook-style adventures 
available on Dungeon Master’s Guild. 
These are a good first port-of-call for 
those just getting into solo D&D, and 
introduce you to many of the 
underlying concepts. We won’t take up 
too much space commenting on these 
adventures here, as if you are 
reading this you are likely already 
aware of their existence. If you 
are interested in discovering 
more about these adventures, simply 
search “Solo Adventures'' on the 
Dungeon Master’s Guild website. 
Also, under Theme on the sidebar 
of that website, you can select 
Solo/Single Player. The thing to 
remember about this style of 
adventure, however, is that they can 
only resolve with one of a set of 
different outcomes. Unlike a freeform 
solo adventure (see below) a gamebook-
style RPG module is necessarily restricted in 
its playable options. 
  
The Freeform Method 
Quite a few players choose this route, which is 
generally a combination of an oracle such as 
Mythic GM Emulator, and a variety of tables and 
generators to provide random content. It might 
also involve a bit of journaling (i.e., you writing 
things down as they happen) which replaces the 
narration of the DM to an extent. TSAT1 is 
based on this method (as is this book) and it is a 
good idea for anyone interested in solo play to 
try this method at least once, in order to get a 
grasp on what aspects of this system might 
work for you. TSAT1 also provided a basic 
oracle, and TSAT2 improves on that oracle, 
and adds an alternate oracle if you really want 
to ramp things up! 
This system differs from the gamebook method 
hugely, in that the player is acting as DM and 
generating, on the fly, all the detail for the 
character’s quests. It requires that you have 
access to a wide variety of tables (the Dungeon 
Master’s Guide and/or The Solo Adventurer’s 
Toolbox both provide a huge selection) and 
requires you to think on your feet.  
For this method, you can either choose a pre-
existing setting (Such as Eberron or Ravnica), 
or you can use this method to flesh out 
your own world as you journey through 
it. Make sure you keep track of 
worldbuilding notes if this is the case. 
 
Running Published 
Modules 
Rather than generating everything 
themselves, many players prefer to 
work with already published materials, 
such as the modules issued by 
Wizards of the Coast, or the many 
adventures available on DM’s 
Guild, and older modules from 
earlier editions of D&D. The 
challenge here, of course, is in 
maintaining surprise. With the 
freeform method mentioned above, all 
content is generated as the adventure 
unfolds, so player vs character knowledge 
is not an issue. With a published module, how 
do you deal with the issue of surprise and 
revelation of knowledge? 
There are a few supplements that deal with 
this. An excellent work by Tom Scutt, entitled 
DM Yourself takes a very detailed and 
thoughtful approach to this area and is highly 
recommended and widely-used by many players 
who prefer this method. It’s available from 
Drivethrurpg. My own product The Dungeon 
Oracle takes the approach of mixing up the 
elements of the story and creating new twists. 
TSAT1 and TSAT2 can also still be used to 
augment published modules in a variety of 
ways.

Start with Backstory 
This is a method that I personally love, as it 
gets your adventure started quickly, gets you 
quickly invested in your characters and what 
happens to them. It can be used in conjunction 
with the classic freeform method detailed 
above. 
Everyone loves creating characters, and for 
solo adventurers this can form the start of their 
adventure. You can use the tools in the Player’s 
Handbook to generate the bonds, ideals, flaws 
and traits of your character, and you can even 
go a step further and use the collection of tables 
from This Is Your Life (p.61-73) from Xanathar’s 
Guide to Everything to provide your character 
with a detailed backstory. 
Once that is formed, you begin your quest 
based on this backstory, and what your 
character would presumably be doing as a 
result of that backstory. The beauty of this is 
that you don’t need to generate some 
disconnected adventure seed in order to start 
adventuring - you simply take advantage of 
your character’s pre-existing motivations. 
This works even better if you are adventuring 
with two PCs. The interplay between their 
backstories can produce some fascinating 
results. 
 
Card-based 
Adventuring 
A method that has become very popular 
recently, card-based adventuring appeals 
hugely due to the beautiful printed resources 
available, the ease of generation of quest 
elements, and the built-in randomness of 
drawing from a deck of cards. There are card 
decks available for the generation of just about 
anything you can think of, and cards can be 
incorporated in a variety of ways. For example, 
you could be using TSAT to generate a 
dungeon, but drawing randomly from an oracle 
deck and a trap deck. Or conversely, you could 
be using a card-based dungeon generator, and 
then using the Battlemap Crawl Method 
(Chapter 1-5) to provide details of what you 
discover. Nothing is set in stone. Take what 
you want from each system and develop your 
own system of solo gaming that suits your 
style.  
Incorporating universal accessories like the 
monster/spell/item/npc etc card packs also 
enables you to maximise tabletop space which 
speeds up the gaming experience. When the 
game flows more easily, it increases immersion. 
Here is a list of outstanding card decks that can 
easily be incorporated into solo adventuring (I 
apologise to your wallet in advance!) 
 
Wizards of the Coast Magic Item, Spell, & Monster 
Cards 
Deck of Beasts / Creature Card Codex (based on the 
excellent books from Kobold Press). 
Lone Wilderlands Print & Play Card System 
Pocketlands Geomorph Cards 
Game Master’s Apprentice Decks 
Nord Games Dungeon Discoveries Decks 
Encounter Building Cards (Location, Trap, 
Combat, Decision) 
Mythic GM Emulator Deck 
Inkwell Ideas NPC deck 
Inkwell Ideas Sidequest Decks 
Dungeon Dealer: Undead Village Deck 
Dungeon Dealer: Maze Decks 
Axebane’s Deck of Many Dungeons 
Deck of Tales by Larcenous Designs 
Pathfinder Flip Tiles (Not really a deck, but can 
easily be used to generate just about any kind of 
adventure environment).  
D&D Dungeon Tiles Reincarnated 
 
The 6d12 Method 
This is a system devised and developed by the 
author to quickly generate adventure elements, 
and works in conjunction with the freeform 
solo method detailed above. It works best when 
you already know what you are journeying 
through. So, a realm-level map or a premade 
battlemap are desirable for this system. 
For the purposes of this system, you use 6 
differently-coloured d12s, each representing a 
different element. For example, red might 
represent NPCs, gold could represent treasure, 
purple for monsters, and so on.  
You can assign your own colours to those 
elements. There are six elements to account for: 
Monsters, Clues, Environment Features, NPC, 
Treasure, and Random Event.  
When d12s hit particular numbers (refer to the 
table) then the element represented by that d12 
is triggered. Thus, a single 6d12 roll can 
generate a large amount of adventure elements. 
This is a quick and simple way to provide detail 
within a solo adventure. 
For a more thorough explanation of the 6d12 
Method, see Chapter 1-4.

Battlemap Crawl 
Method (1-5) 
Chapter 1-5 provides a solo adventuring method 
that attempts to emulate a boardgame-like 
experience, with battlemaps and minis/tokens. 
The rules re-imagine 5e and add a couple of 
new mechanics. It’s an interesting experience if 
you want to try something tactical and a bit 
different from a standard roleplay-driven solo 
adventure.  
In Chapter 1-5a, the same method is presented 
again in a simplified format, more suitable for 
standard freeform solo adventuring.  
 
Realm Crawl Method  
(1-6) 
Similar to the battlemap crawl method, but on a 
larger scale, this is a systematic way to manage 
realm-level travel and hexcrawling. It also 
incorporates the 6d12 method to generate 
adventure elements. More information can be 
found in Chapter 1-6.  
 
Many Methods 
There is no reason why you can’t use a 
combination of these methods, or switch 
between methods to provide variety and 
excitement.  
For example, you could start with the 
Backstory / Character method, then when you 
are ready to make an overland journey, you 
could use the Realm Crawl method, 
occasionally throwing in a bit of card-based 
adventuring when the mood takes you. Change 
up methods and keep it fresh!

Chapter 1-3 
How Do I…?  
Frequently asked questions. 
 
The two books, The Solo Adventurer’s Toolbox and The Solo Adventurer’s Toolbox Part 2, contain a 
wealth of resources related to solo adventuring. However, it can be a tad confusing sometimes as to 
how it all fits together. The table below contains guidance as to how to use these resources, as well as 
ideas for other resources and how they could potentially fit into this picture.  
As always, TSAT 1 is an abbreviation for the first product entitled The Solo Adventurer’s Toolbox. 
 
QUESTION 
ANSWER 
I’m just starting with 
solo D&D. What do I 
do? 
Immediately go and read 1-2: Methods of Solo Adventuring. Figure out 
what playstyle appeals to you the most (freeform, gamebook, running 
modules) and try out the suggestions given in that chapter. 
You could also check Chapter 18 of TSAT1 and the Appendix of this 
book which contain solo playthroughs using many of the tools described 
in this book. This will show you in detail how to run a solo session.  
How do I generate a 
solo quest for my 
characters? 
Chapter 7 of TSAT 1 provides tools for the generation of quests. 
Alternatively, check out p9.73-74 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, the 
tables entitled Dungeon Goals, Wilderness Goals and Other Goals. The 
Other Goals table has some quests that would be suitable for a city 
location.  
Also, you could use any of the random encounter tables in either TSAT1 
or TSAT2 to provide you with a starting point for a quest. Your 
character’s background may also provide a starting point. See 1-2: 
Methods of Solo Adventuring, under the heading Start With Backstory.  
Use keywords. Use the Random Quest Name Generator for something a 
little out of the ordinary (Chapter 4-7). There’s lots of tools to generate a 
quest. But once you’ve selected one you like, stick with it until it’s 
completed.  
How do I go on a solo 
dungeon crawl? 
Use either Chapter 8 of TSAT 1 (Random Dungeon Generation) or the 
Battlemap Crawl system provided in Chapter 1-5 of this book. A 
simplified Battlemap Crawl system is provided in Chapter 1-5a. 
You can also use the random dungeon generator in the Dungeon Master’s 
Guide (pp.290-301) to provide you with a nice dungeon crawl.  
How do I go on a solo 
wilderness crawl / 
manage overland 
travel for my 
characters? 
For this purpose, you can use Chapter 3 of TSAT1 which provides 
simple rules for overland travel, possibly in conjunction with Chapter 9 
of TSAT1: Random Wilderness Generation. 
Or alternatively, try out the Realm Crawl System detailed in Chapter 1-6 
of this book. There is also the 6d12 Method detailed in Chapter 1-4 which 
works with wilderness adventures. 
How do I manage 
urban activities for my 
characters? 
Use Chapter 10 of TSAT1, or Chapter 2-1 of this book, which is a highly 
detailed urban generator. Also, have a look at Chapter 11 of TSAT1 
which deals with downtime activities. And don’t forget the random 
urban encounter tables in both books!

How do I get an 
answer to a question I 
have about my 
character’s adventure? 
Either frame it as a yes or no question to be answered by the included 
oracle (Chapter 1-8 of this book) or else use a keywords table (Chapter 
14 of TSAT1, Chapter 4-4 of this book) to generate a set of words that 
can suggest an answer. 
How do I create an 
NPC? 
Check out Chapter 13 of TSAT1 or pp.89-92 of Dungeon Master’s Guide. 
You could also try searching online for a string of words such as 
generate fast 5e character or generate 5e NPC. That should turn up some 
excellent generators fit for purpose.  
How do I generate a 
combat encounter for 
my solo characters? 
Chapter 16 of TSAT1 provides all the tools you need to generate 
encounters for solo characters. That chapter deals with encounters for 
solo PCs of up to level 15, and duo parties up to level 10. For solo 
encounters of level 16-20 and duo encounters of levels 11-20, check out 
Chapter 5-4 of TSAT2. 
How do I run combat 
in a solo adventure? 
First of all, be aware that you as a solo player will need to make all the 
rolls, both for your PCs and for any monsters they are facing. After that, 
the next question is monster tactics. What do the monsters do? 
Generally speaking, when the monsters are in play, you should ideally 
roleplay them. Figure out what they would do, based on their motives, 
and have them do that, whether it’s good for your characters or not. 
Sometimes, those monsters might figure out they’re outnumbered and 
flee, only to return later and in greater numbers. Have a look at Chapter 
5-1 of this book, which contains an AI to help you run monsters during 
combat. 
How do I generate a 
villain / BBEG? 
The acronym BBEG refers to Big Bad Evil Guy, the villain or final boss 
of your quest. Chapter 5-2 and 5-3 of TSAT2 contain all the tools you 
need to generate a BBEG/villain and their lair. Or, calculate what 
would be a hard or deadly encounter for your characters, and choose a 
monster that fits the theme of your adventure.  
How can I generate a 
town or village? 
Dungeon Master’s Guide. Pages 112-116 contain excellent tables for 
settlement generation. Chapter 2-1 of TSAT2 also contains an urban 
generator 25 pages long, that I have put a lot of time into devising.  
How do I generate 
loot for my 
characters? 
Chapter 17 of TSAT1, or Chapter 7 of Dungeon Master’s Guide. You 
could also use an online loot generator. 
How do I manage 
downtime for my solo 
characters? 
Chapter 11 of TSAT1. Also, the downtime section in Xanathar’s Guide 
To Everything. 
My characters are 
finding it tough! What 
do I do? 
Have a look at Chapter 1-7: House Rules Options / Character Buffs. This 
will provide you with a few ideas to make soloing a bit more achievable 
for your characters, such as max HP and healing surges. When 
calculating encounters, a common error is to not account for small party 
size. Occasionally a house rule or buff is useful for circumventing this 
situation. Using the monster encounter generators in TSAT1 (Chapter 
16) will also obviate this occurrence. Also read p.83 of Dungeon Master’s 
Guide. 
How do I deal with 
secret doors and 
traps? 
The Standard Trap table (p.40) allows you to make 4d100 rolls to 
determine trap type, notice DC, save DC, and potential damage. There 
is also a Wilderness Traps table on p.41. Sometimes in solo gaming we

need to act as “pseudo-DM” and have a bit more knowledge than our 
characters.  
A similar situation arises with secret doors. The heading Traps and 
Secret Doors in Chapter 1-5 (p.53) sheds some light on this. 
Should I keep a 
journal? How detailed 
do I need to be? 
Absolutely keep a journal if you feel the need. However, there’s no need 
to go detailing every passage and room of your dungeon crawl. You can 
map the dungeon as you journey through it on paper, and encounter 
things as you go. Then, when you have cleared the dungeon, you could 
write a brief summary in your journal. It is useful to take note of 
important quest-related developments, NPCs, any clues or information 
related to your quest, but summaries are a good way to journal your 
adventures. Have your characters encounter things, move through 
environments, gain loot etc, and then summarise as you complete each 
stage of your adventure, taking note of important developments. 
Mythic’s concept of threads works well for this.  
The level of detail you record is up to you. Sometimes you might want 
to try running an adventure without journaling as well. But journaling 
is one way to replace the role of the DM as narrator.  
How do I determine 
the DC for my solo 
skill challenges? 
Page 13 of this book contains a table which gives you a good guide 
related to setting DCs for skill challenges.  
James Aeryksson suggests:  
Personally, my method is to just use the result of my skill check to define the 
likelihood of success modifier in my oracle. For example, if I roll a 5, a success is 
unlikely, a 10 it is 50/50 and a 15 it is likely. This avoids me having to 
arbitrarily pick a DC and also keeps me in the dark somewhat about the nature 
of the challenge if I fail. 
How do I add exciting 
challenges that don’t 
involve combat? 
Check out Chapter 3-4: Skill Challenges (p.139) 
How do I roleplay 
discussions with 
NPCs? 
This is a somewhat trickier area. Chapter 12 of TSAT 1 attempts to 
address this with a system involving Charisma checks and “Emotion 
Modifiers”. As time has gone on, I have simply used oracles and 
keywords to run NPC interactions. A lot of how your characters will act 
is determined by their background, so keep that in mind.  
Say for example that your character is trying to get information out of a 
citizen. That could be accomplished with a couple of oracle questions. 
The first might be Is this NPC friendly towards my character? And the 
second might be Do they know the information my character is seeking? Both 
answers can be supplied by oracle rolls.  
DM Yourself by Tom Scutt also has some good thoughts on this. Check 
out Towns & NPCs on p.41 that book. 
Where can I get free 
adventures to start? 
Track down a Facebook group named “Dungeons & Dragons Solo 
Adventures.” There are some free solo adventures available on that 
page.  
How can I see an 
example of solo 
adventuring? 
Chapter 18 of TSAT1 and the Appendix of this book both provide 
example gameplay using the solo systems contained in these books.

 Chapter 1-4 
The 6d12 Method 
 
I devised the 6d12 method as a quick way of 
generating adventure elements on the fly. The 
6d12 system makes use of different-coloured 
d12s to generate content. Within the tables in 
this chapter, I reference several resources (such 
as Tome of Adventure Design and the GM’s 
Miscellany series) to provide content for the 
6d12 system, with the permission of their 
respective authors. If you are not already 
familiar with these resources, I highly 
recommend picking one or two up.  
 
• 
Dungeon Master’s Guide 
• 
GM’s Miscellany: Dungeon Dressing 
• 
GM’s Miscellany: Wilderness Dressing 
• 
Tome of Adventure Design (TOAD) 
 
One thing you might choose to have for this 
system is a hexcrawl map, or large realm-level 
map with scalable distance. In place of a 
detailed campaign map, another thing that 
would work is a way of revealing wilderness as 
you travel through it, such as terrain tiles. In 
the past I have used this system with the hex-
based terrain tiles from the boardgame Mage 
Knight, but you could use this with a resource 
like Pocketlands Geomorph Cards, or even the 
wilderness generation tools included in 
TSAT1. 
If dungeon crawling, you can use a whole 
dungeon map, or something like Pathfinder Flip 
Tiles Dungeon Starter Set to provide you with a 
gradually-revealed map. The first Solo 
Adventurer’s Toolbox and Dungeon Master’s 
Guide also provide dungeon generation tools.  
You may also choose to not use a map, and 
simply rely on theatre of the mind, with the 
6d12 roll providing all detail. If you have an 
idea of the general terrain, then this method is 
totally feasible. 
Use the tables below to furnish details for 
everything you see on the map, and what you 
don’t see. For example, you might enter an area 
where there is a small forest. Go to “What’s On 
The Map” and reference where you can find 
tables that will provide you with extra detail. I 
have referenced two other commonly-used 
resources in this table: GM’s Miscellany 
Wilderness Dressing and Tome of Adventure 
Design. I’ve also included references for TSAT1 
and the Dungeon Master’s Guide. You could also 
simply use oracle or keyword tools to provide 
detail. You may reference these other resources 
if you wish, but don’t feel that you have to. 
They are referenced here for those who like to 
use them, for the sake of convenience. Their 
inclusion or non-inclusion will not affect the 
system. 
The 6d12 system works fine on its own for 
wilderness or dungeon exploration. If this 
system appeals to you, then proceed with 
adventuring! Be aware that the next chapter 
provides another system for exploration, which 
you may want to explore later. Or, you may 
want to get a handle on the different systems 
this book provides and then make your decision 
about which one to use. 
At the heart of the 6d12 system is a dice roll 
using 6d12s. When entering a new area, I use 
different coloured d12s as per the table on the 
following page.

The trigger values are the minimum number that needs to be rolled in order for that element to be 
present. Roll all 6 coloured d12s at once and see what is triggered! Use whatever coloured dice you 
like to trigger your elements.  Combine that with various table rolls and an oracle, and you have an 
action-packed solo adventuring method.  
See over the page for the same table but with the colour column empty. This is for you to print so

HOW TO PROCEED 
Have your characters move into a new map area. Then... 
First, look at what is on the realm map that you are using. Is it forest, hills, mountains, swamp? Is 
there a settlement marked? Based on this, find the relevant feature on the What’s On The Map table 
and roll for details using the table references provided. This will generate details and dressing for 
this area. There is also a What’s On The Map table for dungeon features visible on the map, found 
later in this chapter, if you happen to be using this system for a dungeon crawl. 
 
Now, make the 6d12 roll. 
Roll 6d12s of different colours. A printable table is provided above so that you can enter your own 
colours, based on what d12s you have available. Then, cross reference what those rolls mean. The 
trigger value for each d12 is listed. If your value is below what is listed, that means that the element 
was not triggered. For example, I use a red d12 as my NPC die. If I am in Standard Wilderness (see 
below for a definition) then the die must be 11 or 12 in order for an NPC to be present. If the NPC is 
triggered, then use whatever NPC generation tool you prefer.

STANDARD vs SPECIAL 
When you are rolling in a Special column, the 
chance of elements appearing is increased. You 
may be wondering when to roll for Standard vs 
Special wilderness or rooms. The simplest way 
is to determine this with a d6 dice roll (1-4: 
Standard 5-6: Special). Or, perhaps when in 
wilderness, areas near settlements are standard 
wilderness, and more wild areas are special 
wilderness. In a dungeon, you could decide 
which rooms are special based on what other 
features are present in that room. For example, 
if you roll a room with an altar, you could 
immediately decide that room is special and use 
the appropriate column. Special also refers to 
quest-based rooms, for example the room 
where you’re pretty sure you’re going to be 
encountering the main villain of your quest. 
Basically, if the area you are in has a “quest” 
like feel, then it is special and you should roll in 
the relevant column. It will probably make it go 
worse for you, if anything! 
 
NPCS 
When an NPC result is triggered, use whatever 
resource you prefer to provide details for that 
NPC. TSAT1 has a whole chapter dedicated to 
NPC generation, and the Urban Generator in 
TSAT2 has a table called 100 Quick Citizens 
which is also perfect for quick NPC generation. 
 
BANES & BOONS 
Sometimes certain areas are bound by magic 
curses or blessings which your PCs stumble 
into, triggering the effects. When you roll a 
Boon or Bane result, roll on the corresponding 
table (Chapter 4-1 or 4-2) to discover the effect.

SKILL CHALLENGES 
Occasionally, a roll on the d12 controlling 
random events will instead produce a skill 
challenge, a test of your character’s prowess. In 
this case, roll on the Skill Challenges table 
(p.139) to discover the nature of this challenge. 
 
Wilderness Features 
When you trigger a feature in a wilderness setting, you may use the table below to provide some 
dressing for that feature. If you don’t need this extra detail, then simply decide, for example, “The 
party finds a campsite” and leave it at that. This extra detail is optional. You can use the GM’s 
Miscellany Wilderness Dressing, Tome of Adventure Design, TSAT1 or the DMG to provide details 
regarding this feature.  
The page details given for the GM’s Miscellany Wilderness Dressing resource are the printed page 
numbers at the bottom of that book. If searching within a pdf, you may need to scroll forward a 
couple of pages.  Keep in mind that these extra resources are simply meant to provide you with extra 
detail and dressing, not encounters or anything mechanical/5e related.

Dungeon Features / What’s on the Map? 
This table has two possible uses. It allows you to find table reference for things you can already see 
on a map of a dungeon. It also facilitates rolling a d100 to randomly determine dungeon features.  
The page details given for the GM’s Miscellany Dungeon Dressing resource are the printed page 
numbers at the bottom of that book. If searching within a pdf, you may need to scroll forward a 
couple of pages.  Keep in mind that these extra resources are simply meant to provide you with extra 
detail and dressing, not encounters or anything mechanical/5e related. 
Do not feel you have to use these references. Their use is strictly optional, and their inclusion is merely 
for convenience, for those players who like to generate lots of detail. 
You might notice a dash (-) for some results. That’s because certain elements (passage, room, trap) 
aren’t things you generally want to roll when you’re populating a dungeon. They form the backdrop, 
and are generally established by other means (such as random dungeon generators). However, I did 
want to include them here as there are some nice tables to give those basic elements a bit of flavour.

Chapter 1-5 
Battlemap Crawl System 
 
This chapter contains a rules system for a 
boardgame-style skirmish quest, with 5e rules 
as the base system. It’s designed to be light on 
roleplay and fast on action, perfect if you’re in 
the mood to roll some dice and kill some bad 
guys with a bit of story thrown in for flavour. 
This method uses battlemaps / fliptiles / any 
map with a 5 ft. grid on which miniatures (real 
or virtual) can be placed. You complete these 
quests with 2 PCs. It also involves you setting 
Story Points and a BBEG (big bad evil guy) 
location within the map, which you progress 
towards, triggering numbered Story Points 
along the way. You can also run wilderness 
adventures using this system, treating your 
wilderness map like a dungeon map.  
This system also uses a different kind of 
initiative and gameplay sequence, described 
below. 
It is inspired by my own Solo Skirmish system, 
and the idea here is rapid levelling. You 
advance your character’s level after each 
completed quest. This keeps the interest high.  
A third-party resource that works extremely 
well with this system is the series of Sidequest 
Decks by Inkwell Ideas. They have a map, a 
quest goal and story points already provided.  
Read this chapter thoroughly before beginning 
your quest. 
 
Step 1: Print Tables 
It is necessary for the running of this system to 
have a printed copy of the Event Table, the 
Monster Table and the Standard Encounter 
Table. This is so that already-rolled events can 
be tracked. Mark them in pencil so they can be 
erased and the tables re-used.  
You will find these tables later in this chapter. 
You may also find it useful to copy out or print 
the Move Table and Quick Reference Sheet, 
and have them somewhere visible. 
 
 
 
Step 2: Character 
Creation 
Create 2 PCs at any level you desire. Two buffs 
are recommended for this system: max HP 
(take your maximum hit points + Con mod at 
every level) and healing surges (see Dungeon 
Master’s Guide, p.266). In brief, a healing surge is 
an optional rule that allows you to use an 
action, at any time (including in combat) to roll 
up to half your hit dice and regain hp of that 
value, (including your Constitution modifier 
per hit die rolled). In the battlemap crawl 
system, both PCs and enemies can use healing 
surge. PCs use it at will, enemies use it when 
triggered. Both PCs and monsters can only use 
healing surge once per day. 
From Dungeon Master’s Guide (p.267): 
 
Under this optional rule, a character regains all 
spent Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short 
rest, a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her 
level divided by four (minimum of one die). For a 
more super heroic feel, you can let a character use a 
healing surge as a bonus action, rather than as an 
action. 
 
Step 3: Determine Quest 
Determine a goal for your quest, or use another 
source to provide a quest (such as the Sidequest 
Decks by Inkwell Ideas, or Chapter 7 of 
TSAT1). You could also use the table below to 
provide a basic quest, and then determine the 
specifics using keywords and oracle rolls to 
give it some story and context. Alternately, 
there is a fantastic table on p.73 of the Dungeon 
Master’s Guide named “Dungeon Goals” which 
contains great generic quest ideas. You might 
want to spice these up by adding a few 
keywords for flavour.

Basic Quest Types 
D4 
QUEST 
BBEG 
REWARD 
1 
Fetch Quest 
(obtain item, lost 
or otherwise) 
Optional BBEG. Place item in last room, roll on 
trap table when retrieving it (adding 20 to the 
roll), or encounter BBEG (p.39, p.210) 
Roll on level appropriate hoard table, 
adding 40 to the roll (DMG loot tables, 
pp.137-139), or automatically succeeding 
on the magic item roll (TSAT1 loot tables, 
pp.155-156). Advance 1 level. 
2 
Kill Tyrant 
(Destroy 
dangerous villain 
or monster) 
The simplest kind of quest using this system. 
Roll for BBEG in final room (p.39, p.210). A 
good starting point can be reading monster 
descriptions for flavour ideas. Roll on standard 
monster encounter tables up until the BBEG 
encounter. 
Roll on level appropriate hoard table 
(DMG pp.137-139 or TSAT1 pp.155-156). 
Advance 1 level. 
3 
Rescue Quest 
(Save kidnap 
victim) 
Kill a BBEG and rescue a hostage. This quest 
provides an extra gp award on top of any loot 
you might discover during the quest. Determine 
BBEG with the BBEG table (p.39), and also the 
Villain Generator (p.210). 
Roll on level appropriate hoard table 
(DMG pp.137-139 or TSAT1 pp.155-156), 
take PC level x 200 gp reward. Advance 1 
level. 
4 
Clear Dungeon  
Another nice simple quest for this system. Decide 
on monster theme/type, then set out.  
Roll on level appropriate hoard table 
(DMG pp.137-139 or TSAT1 pp.155-156). 
Advance 1 level. 
 
Step 4: Battlemap 
Find or make a battlemap to use for your quest, 
or plan a battlemap to lay out as you move 
through it (if tabletop space is an issue). Try to 
make it visually appealing, possibly with a few 
features that your characters can interact with. 
Most importantly, ensure it has a 5 ft. per 
square grid.  
Use a map that’s not too big, ideally a 5-6 room 
dungeon, 40x40 squares or thereabouts (these 
are just rough guidelines, and you should go 
with whatever you’ve got available). You may 
find that flip tiles, a large flipmat you can draw 
on, or a succession of battlemaps is ideal for 
this purpose.  
Determine the starting point for your heroes, 
and the location of the final BBEG. When you 
reach this final location, go to Determining the 
BBEG. 
 
Step 5: Enemy Setup 
Choose at least 3 theme-appropriate monsters 
to appear during random encounters, each with 
a different CR. These are your Minion, Soldier 
and Leader monsters, based on their rank. 
Consult the Ranked Monster table below to 
discover what CR your various ranked 
monsters need to be. Choose at least one for 
each category.  Come up with some story as to 
why these particular monsters have banded 
together. Or, perhaps your quest already 
provides this story. 
List them on a separate piece of paper. E.g., for 
a party of 2 x level 2 PCs, you might have: 
 
Minion (CR 0): Cranium Rat, Crawling Claw 
Soldier (CR ⅛): Kobold, Stirge, Giant Rat 
Leader (CR ¼): Goblin, Grimlock 
 
When it comes time to roll for monsters, you 
will use these ranked monsters to form your 
encounters (See Standard Encounter table, 
below). The system aims to give the game a bit 
more thematic story, and speed things along. 
You can also choose to ignore this system, and 
just use random monsters, but do stick to the 
suggested CR if you want your characters to 
have a chance of surviving. 
Later on, you may be directed to encounter 
different combinations of these ranked 
monsters, when you roll on the Standard 
Encounter table. These encounter rolls are 
triggered by a couple of different means.

Step 6: Story Points 
We mentioned Story Points before, which are events to be triggered within the quest. Simply 
wandering into a dungeon and slaying bad guys is a bit two-dimensional. This step is about creating 
some pivotal Story Points that will give your quest some context to underpin all the combat.  
What you want to do is create 3 or more Story Points that can be triggered within your map. You 
could go up to 7 or 8, but be aware that the more Story Points you place, the longer your quest. And 
with this system, the design is aimed at short, compact games rather than epic dungeon crawls 
(although there’s no reason why you can’t do epic dungeon crawls, with a few long rests included). 
At first, these Story Points can simply be numbered points spaced evenly out across the
map. Draw them on your physical battlemap, or use the text layer in your VTT to place them on the 
map. When your characters arrive at these points, that is when you will determine the nature of these 
Story Points. You may already have an idea of what you want these to be, or you may want to leave 
them completely open so you can determine them with oracle rolls and/or keywords. There is a table 
later which provides some generic events also, to give you a basic suggested direction. 
You might simply use the method of placing a Story Point into each room/cavern space in the 
dungeon (just like room key numbers in a module), then use the Story Points to determine what you 
find in each. 
When your characters reach these locations, consult the heading Story Points, below.

Step 7: Initiative 
Roll initiative for your characters. They will take turns in this order for the 
entirety of the quest. At the bottom of the turn order, at Initiative 0, put an 
entry named Event Roll / Monster Roll. This turn order number will 
trigger the Event Roll, which takes place at the end of each round, and also a 
possible Monster Roll (made after the Event Roll), 
which is a roll that is made only if enemies are in play. 
Keep this initiative order the same throughout the 
entire game.  
A sample initiative order might look like this: 
 
 
 
 
When monsters are in play, they take 
their action after the Monster table roll. 
That roll will sometimes direct only 
certain enemies to act (i.e.: Only 
Soldiers, or Leaders, or unwounded 
enemies). 
At all times, your two PCs take 
turns in sequence. Just like in 
regular D&D, a single turn, in or 
out of combat, can consist of the 
following: 
 
Move up to allowance. 
Take one action (Any action 
allowed by 5e rules), or 
move again. 
 
The Quick Reference 
Sheet provides a compact 
summary of gameplay 
that happens over a round 
using this system.

QUICK REFERENCE SHEET 
Once setup is done, this is how gameplay progresses. You’ll find that one round using this 
sequence will go quite quickly, so aim to increase your speed as you play. 
HERO PHASE: On your initiative turn, take a standard 5e D&D action for each PC. That is, 
move each character’s miniature and/or take your character action (if desired), and any bonus 
action. Or take double movement etc, or any other allowable action(s) that a character can take in 
one turn, according to 5e rules, including free actions. If you are out of combat when moving, roll 
a d20 on the Move table (below). Resolve any result.  
EVENT ROLL: Once both your PCs have taken their Hero Phase turn, roll on the Event table 
(printed) and resolve the result.  
MONSTER ROLL: Skip this if there are no monsters in play. If there are enemies in play, roll on 
the Monster table. Monsters take their combat turn directly after the Monster table roll, as specified 
by the result of the Monster table roll. If the BBEG is in play, the BBEG attacks during this phase, 
but do not roll on the Monster table during the BBEG encounter! 
END OF ROUND: Return to the top of the initiative order, repeat from Step 1. 
 
Oracles 
You can also use oracles within this system, to 
ask and answer questions, and to provide extra 
detail, if you so desire. You determine whether 
or not they trigger events that affect balance, 
such as traps and combat encounters. The 
provided system should give you enough of 
that, but if you want to make life really tough 
for your adventurers, by all means have an 
oracle triggering traps and encounters as well! 
 
 
 
 
Resting 
The party may take one short rest during the 
quest. Each PC may also use healing surge once 
per day. 
 
Moving 
Outside of combat, whenever your PC moves, 
they roll a d20. As per 5e rules, If this is at the 
end of a double movement action, they will not 
be able to take an action to deal with whatever 
they find. However, they still roll on the Move 
table regardless. You can also just make one 
move roll for your party. If you get the result 
Something found, then roll on the What Found 
table.

Clue found. Roll on Item table (p.163) and gain 1 Clue Point. If necessary, reroll on Item table until you get 
something that makes sense given the context. Add this detail to the narrative of your text. It will influence 
future events. You could also use the clue tables in Chapters 8 and 9 of TSAT1. 
20 
Loot Found. Roll on [d6] (1-5) individual treasure table (6) hoard table, based on CR of most recent monster 
encountered. This could be on a corpse or a container of some kind (like a chest). Determine with oracle rolls. 
 
 
Clue Points 
Clue points are tradable for inspiration, at a 
rate of 1 CP = 1 inspiration. It is recommended 
that you use these inspirations when you get 
the opportunity so that more can be awarded. 
Also, Clue points can be used to increase your 
“What Found” roll. Trade 1 CP to increase or 
decrease your roll by 5. You can do this after 
you have seen the result of the roll. 
And a final use for Clue points: they can be 
subtracted from Standard Encounter rolls when 
determining difficulty (d4). 
 
Interacting with Stuff 
on the Map 
If you have taken the time to select a battlemap 
that has a few interesting features on it, then 
you may want to furnish details for those 
features. Use the following table to locate 
tables that can provide these details. This table 
is also found in the 6d12 system, Chapter 1-4. 
There is a similar table for wilderness features 
in the Realm Crawl System, Chapter 1-5.

Dungeon Features / What’s on the Map? 
This table has two purposes. It allows you to find table references for things you can already see on a 
map of a dungeon. It is also rollable, so if you need to determine what dungeon feature you have 
found, you easily can. The amount of detail you generate is up to you. If you find an altar, you could 
simply leave it at that, an altar, without any extra detail. However, if you like a little extra flavour, 
the references below should point you towards several resources where this can be generated. Use of 
these is strictly optional, purely for flavour, and will not affect the system at all if used / not used. 
You might notice a dash (-) for some results. That’s because certain elements (passage, room, trap) 
aren’t things you generally want to roll when you’re populating a dungeon. They form the backdrop, 
and are generally established by other means (such as random dungeon generators). However, I did 
want to include them here as there are some nice tables to give those basic elements a bit of flavour.

Story Points 
When one of your characters is present for the first time in a space that triggers a Story Point, follow 
these two steps: 
1. Roll on the Story Point Table below.  
2. Use any combination of keyword tables and oracles required to give this story point some 
context and detail.

Entering Rooms 
In addition to rolling Story Points, you might also want to make a roll on the table below when 
entering rooms, in order to find out what each room contains. Have the character who moves into the 
room first finish their move action to get in the room, then roll on the table below (if desired). If there 
is no monster, then they continue with rolling on the Move table. Other tables will produce monster 
encounters, but if you are keen to kick things along (perhaps the action has stalled somewhat) then 
this can provide another layer of detail and possible combat encounters. Perhaps the map you are 
using provides some details, but the table below will also provide quick contents for any chamber or 
cavern.  
Alternately, if you want a higher level of detail, use the Chamber Contents tables from Dungeon Master’s 
Guide (p.296-301) which provide detailed contents, furnishings and everything else you could think 
of. You could even roll on both if you like.    
 
 
Room Contents Table (optional) 
d100 
CONTENTS 
NOTES  
1-12 
Empty Room 
Roll 1d4 random items from Chapter 4-3: Item table (p.163).  
13-25 
Empty Room with 
feature 
Roll on Random Architecture/Feature table (TSAT1, p.50). Also roll 1d4 random items 
from Chapter 4-3: Item table (p.163). 
26-37 
Empty Room with 
treasure 
Roll a d8. (1-7) Individual treasure (8) Hoard (use CR of highest CR monster in last 
encounter). Also roll 1d4 random items from Items table (p.163). 
38-50 
Trap 
Roll on Standard Trap table (p.40). 
51-62 
Monster 
Roll for a combat encounter. 
63-75 
Monster with 
treasure (individual) 
Roll for a combat encounter. Use monster CR to generate treasure (individual rather 
than hoard).  
76-87 
Monster with 
treasure (hoard) 
Roll for a combat encounter. Use monster CR to generate treasure (hoard).  
88-100 
Random Event 
Roll on the table in Chapter 3-3: Dungeon Encounters (p.133). 
Flavour Rolls 
You may also make rolls for any features you 
see on the map, anything you want to provide 
detail for. In this regard, the What’s On The 
Map table earlier in this chapter (or, for the 
wilderness version, p.24) might be quite useful. 
 
Standard Encounters 
Roll on the below table when determining 
standard encounters during the course of the 
game. Use your ranked creatures to populate 
your encounters (Leader, Soldier, Minion). This 
table is based on the presumption that you are 
adventuring with 2 PCs. You may wish to roll 
keywords with your encounter as well, to give 
it some flavour and story, and fit it within the 
tale of your current quest.  
You may spend Clue Points to subtract d4 from 
the d20 dice roll if desired The ratio is 1:1. 
(Minimum result 1). 
Roll a d12 to determine how many squares each 
monster is from your party/hero. 
Print or copy out this table. After each 
encounter, mark X in the box below the 
encounter category. This is so that hard and 
deadly encounters do not recur too often. A roll 
of 10 resets this. You could also simply note 
down what encounter categories you have 
encountered as you go. If you roll an already 
marked result, reroll. 
Roll on the Individual Treasure table for every 
monster you defeat, according to their CR 
(TSAT1, pp.152-154). You will roll on the 
Hoard table after the BBEG encounter. 
Remember, as directed in that chapter, you can 
always substitute the treasure tables in the 
Dungeon Master’s Guide (pp.136-139).

Determining Surprise 
Play this out in the context of the story. The 
way that monsters appear suddenly in this 
system means that, once they are on the map, 
have the players retrospectively determine if 
they were able to sneak up on them. Have them 
make Dexterity (Stealth) checks, measured 
against the monsters’ passive Perception. If 
they succeed, then the monsters will be 
surprised.  
If they fail, then make the same check for the 
monsters. 
 
Another Method 
If you wish the monster selection to be more 
random, check out the heading Combat 
Encounters found in the Realm Crawl System 
chapter (p.61) or use a combat encounter 
generator of your choice. 
 
Determining Monster 
Targets 
A simple method for determining which of your 
characters a given monster attacks is to roll a 
d4. 1-2, it attacks the first character, 3-4 it 
attacks the second. This little roll can provide a 
lot of suspense! If there’s a sidekick then make 
it a d6 and divide accordingly. Alternately, you 
can divide the attacks evenly between 
characters. You can also use die rolls to 
determine which attack a monster uses. Either 
count the number of attacks and make a dice 
roll to determine it, or else create a customised 
table for that monster. 
 
Monster Loot 
Unless it is specifically generated by the 
system, standard encounters do not generate 
loot, although the BBEG does. Roll a hoard 
according to CR once the BBEG is defeated. 
 
Determining the BBEG 
Roll a d4 to determine how many monsters you 
are facing in your final encounter, or simply 
decide. The theme/story of the dungeon should 
provide you with the monster type. Alternately, 
use an encounter calculator or generator of 
your choice to determine this final encounter. 
Make the encounter hard or deadly. 
Also, take note of whether the encounter is 
Hard or Deadly and make your decision based 
on that. 5e is pretty forgiving, so my opinion is 
the harder the better. If it is hard and you want 
to make it deadly (or if your PCs are finding 
things too easy), increase the CR by 1. But be 
warned, this could result in character death! 
Use character actions to sneak up on the 
BBEG,  
 
Playing the BBEG 
As mentioned before, you do not make Monster 
Rolls during the BBEG encounter. When the 
BEEG encounter starts, reroll initiative for 
monsters and characters, just like in a regular 
D&D game. Simply try to play the BBEG as 
true to form as possible, activating attacks and 
other traits that make sense given the 
creature’s motives and the circumstances. Read 
the BBEG stat block in detail and think about 
what you think the final boss’s demeanour 
would be towards the heroes, based on how the 
story has developed. You could also use oracle 
rolls to determine whether the BBEG makes 
certain attacks, changing the likelihood 
modifier as you see fit. There is also a Random 
Monster Combat AI (p.206) that you could use to 
determine the BBEG’s behaviour. 
The BBEG takes their turn after the Event 
Roll, every round. If your party acquires a 
sidekick, or you gain a magic item that you can 
use in combat, perhaps recalculate the boss 
fight accordingly.

Between Quests 
When your characters complete a quest, level 
them up. This keeps interest high, but also 
means that the system will present them with 
more challenging enemies.  
Perhaps your heroes are based in a town. This 
is a desirable situation, as they can stock up on 
equipment between quests, change money and 
do other downtime activities in preparation for 
the next quest. Use the opportunity to stock up 
on healing potions for the next quest, if you feel 
the need is there. 
You can use an oracle to run their downtime, 
and their travel to new quest locations. You 
may even decide to throw in the odd combat 
encounter on their way to the next quest 
location, or use the Wilderness Generator in 
TSAT1 to run their journey to the location. 
There is no reason you can’t switch between 
systems as you go. Whatever provides the most 
fun for you. You could even use the 6d12 
system for your overland travel, or the Realm 
Crawl system provided in the next chapter.  
 
Traps & Secret Doors 
There are situations that arise in solo play 
where you need to have more knowledge than 
your characters. Two examples of this are traps 
and secret doors. The table below requires 4 x 
d100 rolls to determine trap type, notice DC, 
save DC and potential damage.

---

## Page 40

40 
 
Once you have determined notice DC, roll 
Perception roll for your characters (or match it 
against their passive Perception based on 
circumstance). If they succeed, then you could 
rule that they see the trap and subsequently 
avoid it (if they fail, then have them make the 
appropriate check against the save DC you 
determined with a d100 roll. This would be a 
Constitution save for poison, Dexterity for a 
spear trap, possibly Strength to run away from 
a rolling sphere… use your best judgment.  
With secret doors, once again the pseudo-DM 
role is required. A secret door might appear 
through dungeon generation, or perhaps 
through a feature roll using the Battlemap 
Crawl system (this chapter). First, determine 
how hard the secret door is to spot, perhaps 
through an oracle question, or even just a 
straight d20 roll. Perhaps the secret door was 
used recently and did not close properly, or 
perhaps it is broken and easily noticeable. If in 
perfect working order, set the DC high. Use the 
Typical DCs table (p.13) to give you an idea. 
Then, your PCs make a Perception or 
Investigation check to see whether they notice 
it. If not, then they proceed as if they were not 
aware of its existence.  
 
Standard Trap Table (Make 4 rolls) 
This table is reprinted from TSAT1, p.51. 
(Optional: Add the crafter’s wisdom mod to the notice DC. If you are rolling to see what trap type someone is 
caught in, roll until you get an appropriate trap type result.)

Event Roll  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Print this sheet) 
 
Every round, when it comes up in initiative, roll on this table. Even if the event doesn’t seem to do much, or anything, resolve it by 
placing a pencil tick in the box to the right of the result and reacting to any effects. You will need to erase these marks, so pencil is ideal. 
If on subsequent Event Rolls, you get an already marked result, roll a d20. After you have seen the result of this roll, you may spend a 
Clue Point (or more) to add to the result of the d20 roll. 1 Clue Point is worth +10 to the result. You cannot achieve the 100: Lost Relic 
result through any method except a crit on a d100. If you roll an already marked result, roll a d20. (1-10) Resolve the next lowest 
unticked result. (11-20) Resolve the next highest unticked result. Don’t forget to X this result too.

surprised during the next round.  
If engaged, all enemies attack.  
  
6-10 
Monster Ally 
Spawn 1 extra monster of the same CR as the lowest CR monster you are currently fighting 
(unless you are fighting the BBEG, in which case spawn a minion). Otherwise, spawn 1 monster 
of the same CR as the last monster you defeated.

Monster Roll 
(Print this sheet) 
 
NOTES: Do not roll on this table during the BBEG encounter! 
Every round, when it comes up in initiative, roll on this table. After rolling, place a pencil mark in the box to the right of the result. You 
will need to erase these marks, so pencil is ideal. If on subsequent Monster Rolls, you get an already marked result, roll a d20. Enemies 
get to use healing surges in this system - keep track of this as each enemy only gets one healing surge. 
If you roll an already marked result, roll a d20. (1-10) Resolve the next lowest unticked result. (11-20) Resolve the next highest unticked 
result. Don’t forget to X this result too. 
 
d10 RESULT 
X when 
rolled 
1 
Hold 
No enemies move or attack. Enemies use healing or tactical ability if they have it available, or else they 
use healing surge. Each monster may only use healing surge once per day. 
 
2 
Berserker 
1 enemy attacks the closest hero twice. 
That enemy is a [d8] (1-4) Minion (5-7) Soldier (8) Leader. 
If the rank isn’t in play, reroll. 
If only one rank is in play, one enemy attacks. 
 
3 
Defense 
All enemies take one of the following actions (roll for each enemy separately): 
[d4] (1) Healing surge (2) Shove (3) Dodge if they are in melee, or Hide if they are not in melee (4) Hide, 
or Disengage and move if they are in melee, getting as far away from heroes as they can (but still 
keeping an action). If possible, they move to an area where they can’t be flanked. 
Next round, skip the monster roll and have all enemies attack (using a ranged attack if not in melee). 
 
4 
Move 
Unless flanking, one enemy who has ranged attacks moves to their allowance as far away from all 
heroes as possible, incurring attacks of opportunity if necessary. That enemy will continue to make 
ranged attacks for the rest of the encounter, unless a hero engages it in melee, in which case it will 
switch to melee attacks. If no enemies have ranged attacks, then one enemy attacks.  
All enemies make ranged or melee attacks according to their position relative to the party.  
 
5 
Random 
2 random enemies attack. Count the enemies and make a dice roll to determine which ones attack. For 
example, if there are 5 enemies in play, roll a d10 twice and divide each result by 2 to determine which 
2 of the 5 attack (reroll for repeats). If there is only one or two enemies in play, they all attack. 
 
6 
Rally 
Only unwounded enemies attack. Wounded enemies use healing ability if they have it available, or use 
healing surge (unless they are the only remaining enemy in combat, in which case they only attack, but 
do not use healing surge or any other ability). 
 
7 
Shuffle 
Erase all marks from the right-hand column, then roll again. If there are no marks, roll again.  
 
8 
Enforcers 
Only Soldiers attack, or if no Soldiers, the second most powerful enemy. Otherwise, all enemies attack.  
 
9 
Stoush 
All enemies who are within 5 ft. of heroes attack (spreading their attacks evenly among heroes), or use 
ranged attacks. Skip monster roll in next round and have all enemies attack. Then all enemies who 
cannot attack this round use their full move allowance to allow them to attack next round, getting into 
flanking positions if possible. Skip monster roll in next round and have all enemies attack. 
 
10 
Boss 
Only Leaders attack, or if no Leaders, 1 Soldier and one Minion. If no Soldiers or Leaders, all enemies 
attack.

Chapter 1-5a 
Simplified Battlemap Crawl System 
 
This version of the battlemap crawl system is 
more stripped down and designed for a more 
standard 5e experience. You use whatever 
combat encounter generation tools you 
normally use, but also incorporate the story 
point system and other features. It is designed 
for players who want a system to help them 
undertake a boardgame-like crawl on a 
battlemap, but with a bit more flexibility to 
incorporate other aspects of solo gaming, such 
as freeform gameplay.  
You will find text from Chapter 1-5 recurring in 
this chapter for ease of reference and gameplay.  
 
Step 1: Character 
Creation 
You may already have PCs that you are 
adventuring with, in which case use these. 
Otherwise, create 2 solo-optimized PCs at any 
level you desire. Check out Chapter 1-7 for some 
ideas about character buffs and other ways to 
make your solo PCs a bit more resilient. 
 
Step 2: Determine Quest 
Determine a goal for your quest, or use another 
source to provide a quest (such as the Sidequest 
Decks by Inkwell Ideas or Chapter 7 of TSAT1). 
You could also use the tool below to provide a 
basic quest, and then determine the specifics 
using keywords and oracle rolls to give it some 
story and context. Alternately, there is a 
fantastic table on p.73 of the Dungeon Master’s 
Guide named “Dungeon Goals” which contains 
great generic quest ideas. You might want to 
spice these up by adding a few keywords for 
flavour. 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic Quest Types 
D4 
QUEST 
BBEG 
REWARD 
1 
Fetch Quest 
(obtain item, lost 
or otherwise) 
Optional BBEG. Place item in last room, roll on 
trap table when retrieving it (adding 20 to the 
roll), or encounter BBEG (p.39, p.210) 
Roll on level appropriate hoard table, 
adding 40 to the roll (DMG loot tables, 
pp.137-139), or automatically succeeding 
on the magic item roll (TSAT1 loot tables, 
pp.155-156). Advance 1 level. 
2 
Kill Tyrant 
(Destroy 
dangerous villain 
or monster) 
The simplest kind of quest using this system. 
Roll for BBEG in final room (p.39, p.210). A 
good starting point can be reading monster 
descriptions for flavour ideas. Roll on standard 
monster encounter tables up until the BBEG 
encounter. 
Roll on level appropriate hoard table 
(DMG pp.137-139 or TSAT1 pp.155-156). 
Advance 1 level. 
3 
Rescue Quest 
(Save kidnap 
victim) 
Kill a BBEG and rescue a hostage. This quest 
provides an extra gp award on top of any loot 
you might discover during the quest. Determine 
BBEG with the BBEG table (p.39), and also the 
Villain Generator (p.210). 
Roll on level appropriate hoard table 
(DMG pp.137-139 or TSAT1 pp.155-156), 
take PC level x 200 gp reward. Advance 1 
level. 
4 
Clear Dungeon  
Another nice simple quest for this system. Decide 
on monster theme/type, then set out.  
Roll on level appropriate hoard table 
(DMG pp.137-139 or TSAT1 pp.155-156). 
Advance 1 level.

Step 3: Battlemap 
Find or make a battlemap to use for your quest, 
or plan a battlemap to lay out as you move 
through it (if tabletop space is an issue). Try to 
make it visually appealing, possibly with a few 
features that your characters can interact with. 
Most importantly, ensure it has a 5 ft. per 
square grid.  
Use a map that’s not too big, ideally a 5-6 room 
dungeon, 40x40 squares or thereabouts (these 
are just rough guidelines, and you should go 
with whatever you’ve got available). You may 
find that flip tiles, a large flipmat you can draw 
on, or a succession of smaller battlemaps is 
ideal for this purpose.  
Determine the starting point for your heroes, 
and the location of the final BBEG. When you 
reach this final location, go to Determining the 
BBEG. 
 
Step 4: Story Points 
Create 3 or more story points that can be 
triggered within your map. You could probably 
go up to 7 or 8, but be aware that the more 
story points you place, the longer your quest. 
And with this system, the design is aimed at 
short, compact games rather than epic dungeon 
crawls (although there’s no reason why you 
can’t do this. Be a bit more generous with 
resting though). Story points aim to provide a 
bit of narrative context to your battlemap 
crawl. 
At first, these story points can simply be 
numbered points spaced evenly out across the 
map. Draw them on your physical battlemap, or 
use the text layer in your VTT to place them 
on the map. When your characters arrive at 
these points, that is when you will determine 
their nature. You may already have an idea of 
what you want these to be, or you may want to 
leave them completely open so you can 
determine them with Oracle rolls. There is a 
table later which provides some generic events 
also. 
You might simply decide to place a story point 
into each room/cavern space in the dungeon 
(like a map key in a module). When your 
characters reach these locations, consult the 
heading Story Points, below. 
  
GAMEPLAY SEQUENCE 
Once setup is done, begin the adventure!  
Every round, your heroes each move, and make a roll on the Move Table. After they have done 
this, they can use their action to react to any events. If they wish, they can also stay still and take 
other actions, but in general the emphasis here is on motion and moving through the battlemap.   
Whenever a combat encounter is triggered, roll initiative, and run the encounter through to 
completion. Then resume moving and rolling on the Move Table.  
 
Oracles 
You can also use oracles within this system, to 
ask and answer questions, and to provide extra 
detail, if you so desire. You determine whether 
or not they trigger events that affect balance, 
such as traps and combat encounters. The 
provided system should give you enough of 
that, but if you want to make life really tough 
for your adventurers, by all means have an 
oracle triggering traps and encounters as well! 
 
Resting 
The party may take one short rest during the 
quest.  
Moving 
Outside of combat, whenever your PC moves, 
they roll a d20. As per 5e rules, If this is at the 
end of a double movement action, they will not 
be able to take an action to deal with whatever 
they find. However, they still roll on the Move 
table regardless. You can also just make one 
move roll for your party. If you get the result 
Something found, then roll on the What Found 
table.

Clue found. Roll on Item table (p.163) and gain 1 Clue Point. If necessary, reroll on Item table until you get 
something that makes sense given the context. Add this detail to the narrative of your text. It will influence 
future events. You could also use the clue tables in Chapters 8 and 9 of TSAT1. 
20 
Loot Found. Roll on [d6] (1-5) individual treasure table (6) hoard table, based on CR of most recent monster 
encountered. This could be on a corpse or a container of some kind (like a chest). Determine with oracle rolls. 
 
Clue Points 
Clue points are tradable for inspiration, at a 
rate of 1 CP = 1 Inspiration. It is recommended 
that you use these inspirations when you get 
the opportunity so that more can be awarded. 
Also, Clue points can be used to increase your 
“What Found” roll. Trade 1 CP to increase or 
decrease your roll by 5. You can do this after 
you have seen the result of the roll. 
 
 
 
 
Interacting with Stuff 
on the Map 
If you have taken the time to select a battlemap 
that has a few interesting features on it, then 
you may want to furnish details for those 
features. Use the following table to locate 
tables that can provide these details. This table 
is also found in the 6d12 system, Chapter 1-4. 
There is a similar table for wilderness features 
in the Realm Crawl System, Chapter 1-6.

Dungeon Features / What’s on the Map? 
This table has two purposes. It allows you to find table references for things you can already see on a 
map of a dungeon. It is also rollable, so if you need to determine what dungeon feature you have 
found, you easily can. The amount of detail you generate is up to you. If you find an altar, you could 
simply leave it at that, an altar, without any extra detail. However, if you like a little extra flavour, 
the references below should point you towards several resources where this can be generated. Use of 
these is strictly optional, purely for flavour, and will not affect the system at all if used / not used.

Story Points 
When one of your characters is present for the first time in a space that triggers a Story Point, follow 
these two steps: 
Roll on the Story Point table below.  
Use any combination of keyword tables, event meaning tables and oracles that you need to give the 
event context, flavour and detail.  
 
Story Point Table 
d100 
Story Point 
1-4 
Encounter 
Roll for a combat encounter using any generator you prefer. 
5-24 
Bane 
Roll on Bane table (p.157). The character who first triggered the Story Point suffers the effect of this bane.  
24-27 
Noticed 
BBEG becomes aware of your presence. During the next monster encounter, monsters have advantage on 
checks to surprise, and heroes have disadvantage on checks to surprise.  
28-31 
Trap  
Roll either the Standard or Wilderness Trap table (pp.53-54) 
32-35 
Puzzle  
You are presented with a puzzle. Make a DC 15 + tier Intelligence check.  
If successful, gain 1 Clue Point. If unsuccessful, lose 1 Clue Point. 
Alternatively, you may want to generate a puzzle by using a riddle tool. 
36-39 
Lost 
You’ve taken a wrong turn somewhere and have lost your way. During the next 3 rounds, you cannot gain a 
Clue Point. 
40-59 
Challenge 
You encounter an obstacle of some sort. Roll on Skill Challenges table (p.139). 
60-63 
Insight 
You discover something, a clue or insight of some sort. Gain a [d6] (1-2) Inspiration (3-4) Clue Point (5-6) Roll 
on a loot table (Individual, CR=highest monster CR from your last combat encounter). 
64-67 
Secret door/Portal  
Take two move actions for free. 
68-71 
Clue 
Roll on Item table (p.163) and gain 1 Clue Point. 
72-75 
Loot 
Roll on Individual Treasure Table for the CR of the highest CR monster you defeated during the last 
encounter. 
76-79 
Random 
Roll on the random encounter table appropriate for your location. (e.g.: 3-3 Dungeon Encounters). 
80-95 
Boon  
Roll on Boon table (p.152). 
96-
100 
NPC 
Introduce NPC/sidekick, who will help PCs for the remainder of the quest. Make them the same tier as the 
heroes.

Entering Rooms 
In addition to rolling Story Points, you might 
also want to make a roll on the table below 
when entering rooms, in order to find out what 
each room contains. Have the character who 
moves into the room first finish their move 
action to get in the room, then roll on the table 
below (if desired). If there is no monster, then 
they continue with rolling on the Move table. 
Other tables will produce monster encounters, 
but if you are keen to kick things along 
(perhaps the action has stalled somewhat) then 
this can provide another layer of detail and 
possible combat encounters. Perhaps the map 
you are using provides some details, but the 
table below will also provide quick contents for 
any chamber or cavern.  
Alternately, if you want a higher level of detail, 
use the Chamber Contents tables from Dungeon 
Master’s Guide (p.296-301) which provide 
detailed contents, furnishings and everything 
else you could think. You could even roll on 
both if you like.    
 
Room Contents Table (optional) 
d100 
CONTENTS 
NOTES  
1-12 
Empty Room 
Roll 1d4 random items from Chapter 4-3: Item table (p.163).  
13-25 
Empty Room with 
feature 
Roll on Random Architecture/Feature table (TSAT1, p.50). Also roll 1d4 random items 
from Chapter 4-3: Item table (p.163). 
26-37 
Empty Room with 
treasure 
Roll a d8. (1-7) Individual treasure (8) Hoard (use CR of highest CR monster in last 
encounter). Also roll 1d4 random items from Items table (p.163). 
38-50 
Trap 
Roll on Standard Trap table (p.40). 
51-62 
Monster 
Roll for a combat encounter. 
63-75 
Monster with 
treasure (individual) 
Roll for a combat encounter. Use monster CR to generate treasure (individual rather 
than hoard).  
76-87 
Monster with 
treasure (hoard) 
Roll for a combat encounter. Use monster CR to generate treasure (hoard).  
88-100 
Random Event 
Roll on the table in Chapter 3-3: Dungeon Encounters (p.133). 
Flavour Rolls 
You may also make rolls for any features you 
see on the map, anything you want to provide 
detail for. In this regard, the What’s On The 
Map table earlier in this chapter (or, for the 
wilderness version, p.24) might be quite useful. 
 
Determining the BBEG 
Roll a d4 to determine how many monsters you 
are facing in your final encounter, or simply 
decide. The theme/story of the dungeon should 
provide you with the monster type. Alternately, 
use an encounter calculator or generator of 
your choice to determine this final encounter. 
Make the encounter hard or deadly. 
Also, take note of whether the encounter is 
hard or deadly and make your decision based on 
that. 5e is pretty forgiving, so my opinion is the 
harder the better. If it is hard and you want to 
make it deadly (or if your PCs are finding 
things too easy), increase the CR by 1. But be 
warned, this could result in character death! 
Use character actions to sneak up on the 
BBEG,  
 
Playing the BBEG 
When you reach the BBEG encounter, roll 
initiative and encounter the BBEG (big bad evil 
guy). Try to play the BBEG as true to form as 
possible, activating attacks and other traits that 
make sense given the creature’s motives and 
the circumstances. Read the BBEG stat block in 
detail and think about what you think the final 
boss’s demeanour would be towards the heroes, 
based on how the story has developed. You 
could also use oracle rolls to determine whether 
the BBEG makes certain attacks, changing the 
likelihood modifier as you see fit. There is also

---

## Page 52

52 
 
a Random Monster Combat AI (p.206) that you 
could use to determine the BBEG’s behaviour. 
The BBEG takes their turn after the Event 
Roll, every round. If your party acquires a 
sidekick, or you gain a magic item that you can 
use in combat, perhaps recalculate the boss 
fight accordingly.

Between Quests 
When your characters complete a quest, level 
them up. This keeps interest high, but also 
means that the system will present them with 
more challenging enemies.  
Perhaps your heroes are based in a town. If this 
is the case, they can stock up on equipment, 
change money and do other downtime activities 
in preparation for the next quest. Use the 
opportunity to stock up on healing potions for 
the next quest, if you feel the need is there. 
You can use an oracle to run their downtime, 
and their travel to new quest locations. You 
may even decide to throw in the odd combat 
encounter on their way to the next quest 
location, or use the Wilderness Generator in 
TSAT1 to run their journey to the location. 
There is no reason you can’t switch between 
systems as you go. Whatever provides the most

fun for you. You could even use the 6d12 
system for your overland travel.  
 
Traps & Secret Doors 
There are situations that arise in solo play 
where you need to have more knowledge than 
your characters. Two examples of this are traps 
and secret doors. The table below requires 4 x 
d100 rolls to determine trap type, notice DC, 
save DC and potential damage.  
Once you have determined notice DC, make a 
Perception roll for your characters (or match it 
against their passive Perception based on 
circumstance). If they succeed, then you could 
rule that they see the trap and subsequently 
avoid it. If they fail, then you have them make 
the appropriate check against the save DC you 
determined with a d100 roll. This would be a 
Constitution save for poison gas, Dexterity for 
a spear trap, possibly Strength to run away 
from a rolling sphere… use your best 
judgment.  
With secret doors, once again the pseudo-DM 
role is required. A secret door might appear 
through dungeon generation, or perhaps 
through a feature roll using the Battlemap 
Crawl system (this chapter). First, determine 
how hard the secret door is to spot, perhaps 
through an oracle question, or even just a 
straight d20 roll. Perhaps the secret door was 
used recently and did not close properly, or 
perhaps it is broken and easily noticeable. If in 
perfect working order, set the DC high. Use the 
DCs table from p.238 of Dungeon Master’s Guide 
to give you an idea. Then, your PCs make a 
Perception or Investigation check to see 
whether they notice it. If not, then they proceed 
as if they were not aware of its existence.  
 
Standard Trap Table (Make 4 rolls)  
This table is reprinted from TSAT1, p.51. 
(Optional: Add the crafter’s wisdom mod to the notice DC. If you are rolling to see what trap type someone is 
caught in, roll until you get an appropriate trap type result.)

Chapter 1-6 
Realm Crawl System 
 
When moving between quests or travelling 
overland you need a system that can support 
realm-level travel. A system for this was given 
in Chapters 3 and 9 of TSAT1. In this chapter, 
we present an alternate system for overland 
travel that takes a bit of inspiration from 
boardgame-like mechanics.  
It is presumed that this realm travel is your 
party travelling towards an active area in your 
quest. During this, you may pick up clues etc, 
but your actual quest begins in earnest when 
you arrive at what you consider to be your 
destination. More or less. Sometimes, as you 
will see, the dice quickly get you involved in 
events that seem pretty quest-like! 
What we want to do here is establish a set of 
mechanics and sequence of gameplay that deal 
with this level of travel.  
 
Step 1: Find Realm Map  
You need a map that addresses world-level 
geography, or a resource that will 
automatically generate said geography. If you 
are adventuring in the Forgotten Realms, there 
is a map (downloadable in various resolutions) 
available on the Wizards of the Coast website. 
In general, you need a map that shows towns, 
forests, bodies of water etc.  
You’ll need to get an idea of scale. Imposing a 
hex or square grid over the top is useful, and 
making each hex or square a factor of 30 is a 
good idea, as 30 miles is what an adventuring 
party generally covers a day (according to 5e 
rules).  10 or 5 miles per square seems like a 
good scale, so that during your realm-level 
travel you are entering 3 or 6 squares a day 
respectively. Keep in mind that the smaller the 
scale your map is, the more events your PCs 
will have during the course of a day using this 
system. For example, 1 mile per square would 
require 30 different rolls per day, which could 
become burdensome. Try to find a scale that 
works for you.  
You may also be adventuring in previously 
uncharted realms, and for this purpose there 
are a number of resources you can use to 
generate wilderness terrain automatically. 
TSAT1 Chapter 9, contains a full system for 
generating wilderness terrain as you move 
through it.  
There are also a number of card-based systems 
for generating maps. The outstanding card 
deck Pocketlands Geomorph Kingdom Cards, 
provide realm-level terrain which can be 
randomly drawn to provide detail for your 
wilderness maps. Lone Wilderlands is another 
excellent resource in this regard, although this 
is more of a complete game system than a 
dedicated mapping tool. Perhaps you even want 
to make your own cards to generate wilderness 
terrain randomly. 
Once you have a map resource ready, determine 
where your adventurers are starting, and go 
from there.

STEP 2: INSERT STORY 
POINTS 
Just like in the Battlemap Crawl method, take 
time to insert some story points on your map. 
Decide where you want these to be - you’re the 
DM after all! - and make them numbered points 
on your map that trigger events, the nature of 
which will be determined as you play. One 
guiding principle I follow in solo gaming is 
this: it’s better for the gaming experience if 
something happens, rather than something not 
happening. Placing story points on your realm 
map ensures that something happens.  
When your characters reach these locations, 
consult the heading Story Points, below. 
  
BEFORE SETTING OUT 
Before you leave a town or settlement, think 
about prepping for the journey. Some healing 
potions, weapon and armour upgrades and 
other things might be wise. Also, perhaps your 
characters might spend time in the city and get 
a quest before departing, which will provide 
them with some context to the different clues 
and events that might transpire once they set 
out. You could use TSAT1, Chapter 7 to 
generate a quest. Or, perhaps your characters 
just leave to go on a pure exploration trip.  
ORACLES 
As always, you can also use oracles within this 
system, to ask and answer questions, and to 
provide extra detail, if you so desire. For an 
extra level of action, try the Alternate Oracle 
detailed in Chapter 1-8.  
 
REALM CRAWL SEQUENCE: 
TRAVELLING / ENTERING 
NEW AREAS (eg hexes) 
When your party travels and enters a new hex 
or square on your realm map, follow the 
sequence below. 
 
STEP 1: TERRAIN DRESSING 
If using a premade map: 
Provide/roll details for things already on the 
map (What’s On The Map? table, below).  
 
If generating terrain as you go: 
• 
Generate terrain (TSAT1 Chapter 9). Or 
use some other resource, such as Pocketlands 
Geomorph cards  
• 
Provide details of that terrain (What’s On 
The Map? table, below).  
 
 
What’s on the Map? (Wilderness) 
If you already have a mapped resource, you can use this for extra dressing, or ignore it if you wish.

STEP 2: ROLL FOR 
ADVENTURE ELEMENTS 
Next, roll to see if anything else is noticed that 
is not marked on the map. Use the 6d12 table 
(found below). 
Whenever the party travels to a new hex or 
square on your realm map, make a 6d12 roll on 
the table below. For more information on the 
6d12 system, see Chapter 1-4. In brief, you 
assemble 6 d12s of different colours, and use 
these to trigger various elements.  
Use the Special Wilderness column whenever 
you are rolling in a hex that contains a 
numbered Story Point. Or, whenever you feel 
like it. Sometimes things will be present that 
are obviously related to your adventure, and 
make that space significant without there being 
a Story Point present.

MUNDANE ITEMS 
If the mundane item you discover is clearly 
related to your quest, then it is a clue. Likewise, 
if you gain vital information through an 
encounter or some other source. In such cases, 
gain a Clue Point.  
 
BANES & BOONS 
Sometimes certain areas are bound by magic 
curses or blessings which your PCs stumble 
into, triggering the effects. When you roll a 
Boon or Bane result, roll on the corresponding 
table (p.152 or p.157) to discover the effect. 
 
SKILL CHALLENGES 
Occasionally, a roll on the d12 controlling 
random events will instead produce a skill 
challenge, a test of your character’s prowess. In 
this case, roll on the Skill Challenge table (p.139) 
to discover the nature of this challenge. 
 
Random Event 
When you get this result from a roll in the 
Standard or Special Wilderness column, roll on 
the Wilderness Encounters table, p.119. 
CLUES & CLUE POINTS 
You may find it useful to list your clues on a 
separate piece of paper, or separate document. 
Having them all in the same place makes them 
easier to piece together into a coherent whole, 
enabling you to uncover the mystery of your 
quest.  
The optional Clue points are tradable for 
inspiration, at a rate of 1 CP = 1 Inspiration. It 
is recommended that you use these inspirations 
when you get the opportunity so that more can 
be awarded. 
Also, Clue points can be used to increase your 
roll on the Story Event Table. Trade 1 CP to 
increase or decrease your roll by 10. You can do 
this after you have seen the result of the roll. 
 
WILDERNESS FEATURES 
When you trigger a feature and you are in the 
wilderness, use the Wilderness Features table to 
determine what that feature is. Then you could 
use TSAT1, Tome of Adventure Design or GM’s 
Miscellany Wilderness Dressing resource to 
furnish details about that feature. If you do not 
have these, just use a keywords resource or 
oracle to furnish details.

d20 
Difficulty

Then, depending on level, go to either Chapter 
16 of TSAT1 (Level 1-15) or Chapter 5-4 of 
TSAT2 (Level 16-20) to generate your 
encounters. Roll on the appropriate table 
according to terrain and difficulty. You may 
wish to roll keywords with your encounter as 
well, to give it some flavour and story, and fit it 
within the tale of your current quest. Use the 
Monster AI (p.206) to determine what the 
monsters do. 
If you wish to determine a theme for your 
monster encounter, then instead of rolling in 
Chapter 16 you could use the following table to 
provide you with your monster type. Or, simply 
decide.

Roll on the Individual Treasure table for every 
monster you defeat, according to their CR 
(TSAT1, pp.152-154). You will roll on the 
Hoard table after encountering any boss 
monsters (BBEGs). Remember that, as directed 
in that chapter, you can always substitute the 
treasure tables in the Dungeon Master’s Guide 
(pp.136-139). 
 
Determining Surprise 
Play this out in the context of the story. The 
way that monsters appear suddenly in this 
system means that, once they are on the map, 
have the players retrospectively determine if 
they were able to sneak up on them. Have them 
make Dexterity (Stealth) checks, measured 
against the monsters’ passive Perception. If 
they succeed, then the monsters will be 
surprised.  
If they fail, then make the same check for the 
monsters.

Chapter 1-7 
House Rule Options /  
Character Buffs  
 
Usually in Dungeons & Dragons, a group of 
players bands together to face the challenges 
that the DM throws at them. In solo D&D, 
however, there is sometimes only a single PC 
to face these perils. The combat encounter 
tables given in TSAT1 & 2 take this into 
account and follow the small party encounter 
rules given in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. 
Sometimes, however, even this is not enough 
and since our characters don’t always have 
allies to fall back on, it can be useful to give 
them a buff or two to make them not so 
squishy. Have a look at the options below and 
choose 1 or 2 (maximum) that you think would 
suit your character. 
 
Max Hit points 
One option that I introduced with my solo 
adventure Death Knight’s Squire (although I 
probably wasn’t the first to do it) was the rule 
of granting your PCs maximum hit points. This 
means that, for every level of your PC, you take 
the maximum possible hit points as well as 
your Constitution modifier. It’s an easy to 
remember buff and makes your character 
significantly less squishy.  
For example, a Level 3 barbarian with a 
Constitution of 16 (+3) would have 45 hp.  
3 x 12 (a barbarian’s hit die is a d12) = 36.  
3 (Con mod) x 3 = 9.  
36+9=45 hp.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Healing Surges & 
Potions 
A healing surge (see Dungeon Master’s Guide, 
p.266) is an optional rule that allows you to use 
an action, at any time (including in combat) to 
roll up to half your hit dice and regain hit 
points to that value, (including your 
Constitution modifier per hit die rolled).  
From Dungeon Master’s Guide (p.267): 
 
Under this optional rule, a character regains all 
spent Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short 
rest, a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her 
level divided by four (minimum of one die). For a 
more super heroic feel, you can let a character use a 
healing surge as a bonus action, rather than as an 
action. 
 
Another similar option in this regard would be 
to allow the drinking of healing potions as a 
bonus action. This would be another way of 
replenishing hit points during combat. 
 
Bennies 
The Savage Worlds RPG, which many solo 
RPG-ists enjoy, has a system called bennies 
which some players have said they transfer to 
D&D. It seems to me that a sound approach 
would be to award yourself 1d4 bennies per 
major quest. These can be used in much the 
same way as inspiration, but must be discarded 
at the end of the quest. Combining a house rule 
this powerful with something like the Max Hit 
points rule given above might be a bit game-
breaking, but some people like an easy game 
and are more interested in the story. In the case 
of bennies, perhaps a roleplay-invested player 
might use one to reroll a Charisma 
(Performance) check to have their bard pull off 
a fantastic performance to an adoring crowd. A 
paladin might use a benny to reroll a lay on 
hands roll that turned out a bit low.  
Basically, I see bennies as awarding rerolls for 
failed skill checks, attack rolls, saving throws 
etc.

Clue Points 
A system included in TSAT2, Clue Points are a 
way for story development to grant your 
characters inspiration, giving them a little more 
effectiveness in the course of gameplay. These 
are explained in Chapter 1-5: Battlemap Crawl 
and are part of this system, but you may decide 
to incorporate this idea into your solo system 
however you play it.  
 
Respawning 
If you just cannot part with a favourite 
character, you could take a video-game-like 
approach and have them respawn after death, 
with an experience penalty and any gear not 
attuned lost as a result.  
 
Restricting Monster 
Damage 
An easy way to buff your PC is to restrict the 
amount of damage that enemies can inflict. One 
way to do this would be to make the average 
damage output of a monster its max output. So, 
for example, a worg’s bite attack, which deals an 
average of 10 (2d6+3) damage, has its damage 
restricted to a maximum of 10. This means you 
would still roll for damage, and if the result was 
6, then only take 6 piercing damage. If, 
however the result was 13, then you would 
restrict that damage to 10 piercing. 
 
 
 
Save Points 
Some players do not buff their character, but 
instead treat events such as long rests as save 
points that can be returned to later. If you do 
this, it is worth keeping a journal so that you 
can keep track of any items or other things 
picked up by your character that they would 
lose by returning to such a save point.  
 
Sidekicks 
The sidekicks rule is a fantastic way to 
introduce an easily-manageable NPC to your 
game who can significantly lighten the load on 
your PC. Or, perhaps you use their hit dice to 
provide their level and add them to your 
encounter calculations, in which case you could 
have a sidekick as well as two of the buffs 
detailed here.  
The rules for creating and running sidekicks 
are found within the Unearthed Arcana 
resources on the Wizards of the Coast Website. 
Another great resource is Sidekicks Essentials by 
Paul Metzger, available on DM’s Guild. 
 
LEVELLING UP 
Be consistent about how you level up your 
characters. For example, if you use milestone 
levelling, then decide at what point this 
happens. After every 2-3 quests perhaps, or 
when they finish a particularly difficult quest.  
Or, if they advance via XP, then keep a close 
track of monsters defeated, and perhaps grant 
them XP per quest as well. Level x 400 XP is a 
nice round number to grant as a quest reward, 
and alongside monster XP, should have your 
PCs advancing fairly quickly.

Improved Oracle &  
Alternate Oracle 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The oracle presented herein is a more nuanced 
version than that provided in TSAT1. How is 
this different to Mythic? No chaos factor keeps 
the oracle simple and easy to manage. With 
some systems included herein, the necessity of 
making oracle rolls might be greatly reduced, 
due to tables providing a lot of the inspiration. 
It is when we come to interact with, and seek 
more information on the elements within those 
tables, that an oracle becomes necessary. For 
this purpose, the oracle that follows should be 
simple and easy to memorise.  
 
Step 1: Frame a Yes/No 
Question 
The first stage is to come up with a question. 
This question needs to be framed in such a way 
that it can be answered with one of the 
following three words: yes, no, maybe. 
Example: Can I see any buildings ahead? 
 
Step 2: Determine

Given the circumstances, how likely is it that 
the answer will be yes?

When you get a No, but or a Yes, but result, that 
means something else is going on, which you 
will need to interpret based on the 
circumstances. Example: 
 
Q: Is the door locked? (Likelihood=Possible, 0 
modifier) 
d20 roll, 8. No, but… 
A: No, but it is trapped. (Or, no, but it might be 
trapped. The interpretation would require 
another roll, a skill check possibly). 
 
This might lead to further Q/A rolls.

Alternate Oracle 
If you are playing the Battlemap Crawl system, 
then avoid this alternative oracle, unless you 
want your party to die quickly! 
But just to mix things up a bit and get the 
action moving, try this alternate oracle for a 
different flavour. Combine with the 6d12 
system to truly up the ante.

Can I discover anything about my quest here? 
Has the potential to un-stall a quest that has 
ground to a halt. Combine with keywords. 
 
Does this NPC have any information on… 
Similarly, designed to find detail where there 
might not have been any before. 
 
Do I recognize anyone in this tavern/town/shop? 
Good for activating stuff to do with your 
background. 
 
Do my characters investigate/try the door/flee…? 
Sometimes it’s fun to let the oracle decide what 
your characters do. It adds another aspect of 
unpredictability and surprise to the game.

Chapter 2-1 
Urban Generator /  
Building Settlements 
 
Visiting and Generating 
Settlements 
If you are in town to simply shop or experience 
downtime between quests, then you may want 
to use Chapter 10 of TSAT1, which provides 
easy tools related to finding merchants and 
inns, picking up rumours etc. The chapter you 
are reading currently is for more detailed 
exploration / fleshing out of urban settlements. 
To generate general information about a 
settlement (size, demographic makeup, 
strictness of rule etc) start with Section One: 
Building a Settlement From Scratch. Once you 
have determined basic information about the 
settlement, you can then use Section Two: Street 
by Street Method to explore it, as you might 
explore a dungeon, generating districts and 
businesses as you move through it. Or, you can 
operate more broadly, using oracle questions 
such as can we find an inn? 
It is also worth mentioning that the tables on 
pp.112-116 of Dungeon Master’s Guide are 
exceptional and could also be a possible first 
port of call (replacing the Section One tables, or 
used in conjunction with them). If you don’t 
possess the DMG, think about a way that your 
settlement could be special, some quirk about it. 
Is it, like the image on the cover of this book, 
on a floating island? Within a giant tree? 
Underground? Or just a normal, sprawling 
metropolis featuring many races and cultures? 
Another resource worth mentioning is the 
Raging Swan Press resource GM’s Miscellany: 
Urban Dressing. 
 
Street-By-Street Method 
Sometimes, your characters will enter a new 
settlement, and you just want them to discover 
it as they walk through it, as if exploring a 
dungeon. That is where the following tables 
come into effect. Use the Street-by-Street Method 
tables like a dungeon generator, having your 
characters follow the twists and turns of streets 
until the natural limits of the town’s 
dimensions are reached.  
 
Finding Specific 
Merchants / Using 
Oracles 
There are two approaches to searching for a 
particular type of establishment. The first is to 
ask an oracle question, e.g.: Is there a blacksmith 
in this town? Or can my cleric find a temple to 
Lathander? Now, depending on the size of your 
settlement, you could determine this without 
the need for an oracle roll. For example, in a 
city or metropolis, or even a town, a blacksmith 
is essential and is just something that is going 
to be there. Similarly, an inn, general store, 
town hall and local militia are all going to be 
there. 
Then, it becomes a simple method of using an 
Intelligence (Investigation) roll to determine 
whether your adventurers can find said 
blacksmith, inn or whatever. Determine the DC 
based on the size of the city, friendliness of 
locals etc. 
 
Self-Made District Table 
The second method is to randomly determine 
what district you are in by constructing a 
District Table for your settlement. The table to 
consult to do this is Setup Table 4: Number of 
Districts By Settlement. You use this to construct 
the districts that are present in your town. 
First, determine what size of settlement you are 
dealing with. Let’s say you’ve got a town that 
you want to populate with businesses. So, under 
town on Setup Table 4 we have the direction 
that a town should include 6-13 districts 
including Artisan, Commodities, Government, 
Home & Hospitality, Military, Residential. 
If you are dealing with a town with only 6 
districts, then those are already provided for 
you, as listed above. But that’s a bit boring, we 
want to roll on some tables! So, let’s say that 
there are 10 districts in this town (I’m making 
it 10 so that the districts can be easily 
determined with a d10 roll). That means we 
need to roll 4 more times to determine what 
other districts are present in addition to the

---

## Page 70

70 
 
compulsory ones (as listed on Setup Table 4). 
And the table on which to make these rolls is 
Setup Table 5: District Table. 
So, I create a table with 10 rows, and 6 of those 
I fill with the compulsory districts that must be 
present in a town settlement: Artisan, 
Commodities, Government, Home & Hospitality, 
Military, Residential. Now, rolling on Setup Table 
5: District Table (ignoring the rolls that produce 
districts already present) I get the following 
extra districts: Adventurer’s, Divine, Smith’s, 
Personal Services. If you find this too 
cumbersome, simply choose what extra 
districts to include on your table.  
Here’s how my town district table looks now. 
I’ve arranged it alphabetically; you can arrange 
yours however you like. 
 
 
Example Self-Made District Table 
(Town-sized settlement) 
d10 DISTRICT 
1 
Adventurer’s 
2 
Artisan 
3 
Commodities 
4 
Divine 
5 
Government 
6 
Home & Hospitality 
7 
Military 
8 
Personal Services 
9 
Residential 
10 
Smiths 
 
Now, when I want to determine where I am in 
a town, I can simply roll on this table. The size 
of each district is listed in the right column of 
Setup Table 4. For a town-sized settlement, it’s 
at least two blocks for each district, larger for 
residential. I’m just going with an even two 
blocks per district.  
Then, once I know what district I’m in, I can 
determine what each business in that block is 
by rolling on the Merchants By District tables. 
Keep in mind that there are only 14 different 
districts, so if the number of districts in your 
settlement exceeds this, then simply use Setup 
Table 5 to determine what district you are in. 
 
Entering New Districts: 
Roll for Disturbance! 
Note the Disorder Modifier and Disturbance DC 
which together determine the chance that there 
will be a disturbance happening in a particular 
district. The Disorder Modifier (found on the 
Strictness of Rule Table) helps to determine 
whether there are disturbances in a particular 
area of the city. You use the Disorder Modifier 
when rolling for the Disturbance DC (see District 
Table) for a particular district.  
When rolling for the Disturbance DC, it is a 
straight D20 roll with the Disorder Modifier 
added or subtracted. If the roll is equal to or 
higher than the given DC on the District Table, 
then a disturbance exists in that area. Roll for a 
disturbance on that district’s disturbance table 
(found below). Solving disturbances may often 
result in PCs gaining renown. Use your 
judgement in this regard.   
 
Number of Merchants in 
a District 
Setup Table 4: Number of Districts by Settlement 
gives the average block size for a district within 
a given settlement. A Smith’s District within a 
Metropolis is going to be bigger than a Smith’s 
District within a town. However, I’ve left the 
number of merchants per block up to the player 
to decide. I don’t want this system to be too 
prescriptive. If you really want to determine it, 
just decide on a number, or make a dice roll 
(d10+10?)  
 
Size of Shops 
When drawing your urban map, think about 
how big you want each shop to be? I go with a 
default size of a 15 ft shopfront that goes 30 ft 
back (3 x 6 squares). Some merchants might be 
larger, but this is my default. You choose what 
works for you.

Building supplies are short due to a newly-landed noble constructing a 
castle just outside of town. The thing is, no-one has ever met this noble, or

Home & Hospitality District Disturbance Table

Disturbance 
Possible outcomes / Seeds 
1 
A plague of rats is decimating many warehouses, causing grains and 
many other food sources to become spoiled. 
Where are these vermin coming from? 
2 
A local trap merchant is rushed off his feet making traps for a mage 
who lives somewhere out of town. It is said that this mage is 
constructing a deathtrap dungeon to test worthy champions. 
Sounds intriguing! When will the mage 
announce the contest? 
3 
A fishmonger has returned from his most recent catch with disturbing 
tales of monsters terrorizing the harbour.  
What foul denizens of the deep are out 
there? 
4 
People will pay anything for this particular rare ingredient, and a local 
rare edibles specialist will reward anyone who can find the source of 
this delicacy well. 
What is this strange food and where can 
it be found? 
5 
It’s said that this restaurant was once the best in the city, but now 
something has made their dishes taste awful, and the chefs can’t 
discover what it is. Has someone cursed them? 
Adventurers hired to investigate. 
6 
A local noble is planning a huge banquet to honour a local retired 
adventurer, and the food businesses are rushed off their feet. 
How hard would it be to get an invite to 
this banquet? You’re sure to pick up 
some interesting information if you 
attend.  
7 
A seller of rare wines and liquors has been robbed, cleaned out of all 
their stock. Amongst their vaults were also some vintages said to 
possess magical properties. The owner seems very perturbed by the 
disappearance of these bottles. 
What is the owner not telling you? 
There’s something about these bottles... 
8 
Strange noises have been coming from beneath the streets here. 
Possibly all the rich food has created a ‘fatberg’ in the sewers? Or 
perhaps it is something even more disgusting than that... 
Adventurers with strong stomachs hired 
to investigate. Hopefully this problem is 
only wafer-thin, as they say. 
 
Military District Disturbance Table  
d8 
Disturbance 
Possible Outcomes/ Seeds 
1 
A drunken soldier tells you that revolution is in the air. The local militia are 
tired of the poor treatment and are planning on staging a coup.  
Adventurers either sit back and 
watch it happen, or alert the 
authorities.  
2 
Combat drills are taking place in the streets, putting local vendors on edge. 
What is all the fuss about? 
Is there an invasion coming that 
the locals don’t know about?  
3 
A shortage of steel means that many local weaponsmiths are struggling to 
produce stock. This has made the local militia tetchy and on edge. Tensions are 
high. 
Might be best to move on 
quickly. 
4 
The militia has their sights set on a local bandit camp. Anyone looking vaguely 
suspicious is stopped and interrogated without warning. 
Adventurers could be hired to 
go and rout the bandits and 
retrieve stolen booty. 
5 
The guards are nervous, due to a spate of troll/giant/ogre (pick your monster) 
attacks that have happened in the last few months. It seems that with every 
assault, the creatures are becoming more co-ordinated in their efforts. 
Who knows when the next 
attack on the gates of this 
settlement will come? 
6 
The militia are down to a skeleton crew. Several garrisons have left to take care 
of a nearby incursion threatening the town, inadvertently leaving the town 
vulnerable to other threats. 
The remaining guards are 
nervous, and will probably 
welcome any help the 
adventurers can offer. 
7 
The local militia have had numbers bolstered by a visiting army allied with the 
ruler of the city / realm. However, this has meant there are a lot more 
professional soldiers out and about, which is stretching the town’s resources, 
and the tempers of the local townsfolk, to breaking point. 
Anything could kick off! 
8 
A tournament of knights and warriors, aiming to test martial ability, is 
currently in progress, attracting all comers.  
The adventurers could try their 
hand in these tests of martial 
prowess.

Disturbance 
Possible outcomes / Seeds 
1 
There has been a spate of disappearances in this area. Many people 
suspect the local barber, but regardless, the undertaker doesn’t seem 
too concerned. 
Adventurers hired to investigate. 
2 
A local dealer in pets has just come into possession of the most bizarre 
creature. Word has spread, and crowds have gathered outside the pet-
dealer’s shop, hoping to get a glimpse of the strange creature.  
This merchant might have bitten off a bit 
more than she can chew… or maybe it’s 
the creature that’s going to be doing some 
chewing.  
3 
A bounty hunter who has his offices in this area has gone missing. It 
is uncertain what his last job was, but someone is certain to know. 
A bounty for those who can find the 
missing bounty hunter? 
4 
 A local doctor cannot explain a spate of strange illnesses that she has 
seen recently. Patients come in with strange markings on their bodies, 
then a matter of days later are speaking absolute gibberish and 
exhibiting extremely violent behaviour.  
Perhaps the good doctor has some 
theories about what is causing this illness. 
5 
An urban mage is said to be trapped in his tower. Something has 
imprisoned him in there. Passers-by say that it is something he 
summoned, or perhaps his arcane patron. Others say that his magic 
trinkets have taken on a life of their own. 
Adventurers hired to investigate. 
6 
Someone has been convicted of a crime they did not commit and is 
sentenced to be executed. A lawyer in this area is appealing for help in 
uncovering the truth. 
This lawyer has a theory about who did it 
and needs the investigators to check it 
out.  
7 
The local undertaker is swamped with recently deceased clients and 
their families. Where are all these corpses coming from? Most of them 
he doesn’t even recognize and they all have one strange trait in 
common... 
Are these people even from this town? 
8 
A local guide is recruiting adventurers to help with an expedition into 
nearby dangerous territory. A noble is convinced that a map he 
inherited leads to treasure, and has hired the guide to help him look 
for it.  
Is the party interested? The reward is 
quite good! 
 
Residential District Disturbance Table   
d20 
Disturbance 
Possible Outcomes / Seeds 
1 
Slum lords hiking rents sky high. Residents are on the verge of 
rioting! 
PCs take the disturbance to the local slum 
lord, who is potentially connected with 
organized crime. 
2 
Giant rat (or other nastier) infestation! 
PCs investigate. Probably originating from 
the sewers or catacombs. What else is down 
there? 
3 
A particular group (religious/cult?) has moved into the area. 
Certain narrow-minded residents are not happy. 
PCs move in to mediate? Surely we can all 
get along. 
4 
Brothel setting up shop. Certain narrow-minded residents are 
not happy. 
Frequent spats between residents and brothel 
employees / managers. Also organized crime 
may be involved, strong-arming residents.  
5 
Tavern moving into the area. The resident’s association is 
worried about this attracting “the wrong sort of people”.  
Residents picketing outside tavern, 
sometimes violence erupts.  
6 
Town planning has determined that a new street or road needs 
to run right through this area. They are compulsorily acquiring 
houses. 
Residents in an uproar. Perhaps PCs can take 
this to city hall, acting as representatives? 
Will definitely increase renown in the 
settlement. 
7 
Burglaries have been happening in various houses around here. 
PCs apprehend the villain? Might take some 
staking out.  
8 
Lively block party getting a little too lively. 
The town guard is trying to disband it but it 
looks like a nasty confrontation is imminent. 
9  
A fire has ravaged / is ravaging several houses. 
Does anyone need saving?

Major graffiti / vandalism disturbance. 
Who is perpetrating this, and what does the 
graffiti say? 
11 
Squatters in abandoned houses. And they may not be humanoid! 
Adventurers hired to get to the bottom of 
this situation. 
12 
A sorcerer moved into the area recently, and the smells and 
sounds coming from his house have been alarming residents. He 
hasn’t been seen for several days.  
What is he up to in there? 
13 
A team of archaeologists has found something in the middle of 
someone’s courtyard and are now digging large holes, to the 
dismay of residents. They have the permission of the local ruler. 
What have they found? 
Some sort of ancient tomb, or perhaps 
something that should perhaps be left buried? 
14  
Natural gas, under the streets, is causing explosions.  
PCs investigate cause? Does an explosion 
happen as they are passing through? 
15 
Bodies found in the wall of a particular house, or buried in the 
garden. Historical, or recent? Investigators looking into it.  
This could be the result of an ancient crime.  
16 
A local group of bards is practicing their songs till all hours, 
annoying local residents 
OK guys, we know you love to jam, but this is 
getting ridiculous! 
17  
Gangs of armed thugs, roaming the streets at night, terrorising 
local residents. 
These thugs need to be taught a lesson. 
18 
Local authorities believe that a large building housing many 
tenants in fact connects to a system of tunnels below and is being 
used to ferry criminals and possibly other more dangerous 
individuals to and from the city.  
Adventurers hired to investigate. 
19 
Bizarre smells are coming from a local restaurant. 
What are they cooking in there? Smells 
nasty! 
20 
A wealthy noble has just purchased the entire district from its 
slum-lord owners and is the process of evicting everyone. 
Who does this noble think she is? 
 
Scribes District Disturbance Table

Disturbance 
Possible outcomes / Seeds 
1 
Shortage of ink is making doing business difficult! 
Adventurers contracted to 
go and search for giant 
squid. 
2 
A map vendor has come into possession of a rare map. He can’t really understand it 
as the markings are rather strange. 
Adventurers hired to look 
into it. 
3 
A scribe is offering a reward of 500 gold pieces to the brave soul who can pluck a 
feather from a living roc. They are said to live in a nearby mountain range, and he 
needs a roc feather to serve as a quill in drafting a magical contract.  
Adventurers hired to quest 
into the mountains and 
retrieve a roc feather. 
4 
A local bookseller has come into possession of a disturbing occult tome. Many 
believe it to prophesize a coming doom, and this merchant has cultists protesting 
outside the bookshop. The book is being kept under lock and key, but it’s obvious 
that it is attracting a lot of attention.  
Can you aid this poor 
merchant? They appear to be 
in way over their head. 
5 
Carts carrying wood to the town/city for conversion into paper have been waylaid 
by an army of angry treants. As a result, there is a paper shortage. 
Adventurers asked to 
mediate.  
6 
There is a huge dispute between government officials, the militia and local 
townsfolk. Due to military activity, the armed forces have said they need all 
available paper for the purpose of sending dispatches between encampments. This 
has everyone else who uses paper (government officials, mages, scribes etc) up in 
arms. A black market in paper has emerged. 
Adventurers to look into 
securing another source of 
paper? 
7 
A fanatic local religion is advocating the burning of what they call “profane texts.” 
Certain booksellers are being targeted, and there are mass book burnings taking 
place. A lot of valuable knowledge is being lost, and tensions are high. 
What can the adventurers do 
to quell this fanaticism and 
stop this madness? 
8 
A fire has broken out and threatens to consume several well-loved bookstores. 
If the party can help rescue 
these stores, then they may 
be rewarded with a valuable 
tome or two.

Smith’s District Disturbance Table 
d8 
Disturbance 
Possible Outcomes 
1 
Shortage of commodities such as metals is halting local industry and causing 
strife amongst workers and businesses. 
PCs take on contract to locate 
new source of commodities. 
2 
Oversupply / harsh taxes / disturbances with military funding and local 
economy have caused quite a few smiths to close. 
Adventurers asked to mediate. 
3 
Organized crime is trying to muscle their way into the area, offering 
“protection” and trying to control various blacksmithing businesses. 
Sounds like some thugs need a 
beatdown! Or at least a stern 
talking-to. 
4 
The creation of a large dwarven artifact is causing one forge to emit a huge 
amount of heat from its forges. This is causing inconvenience to other 
businesses, but the owners of this forge are never visible, and no-one has been 
able to even get inside this smithing operation to complain. 
Adventurers asked to 
investigate. 
5 
Workers are being mistreated in several smiths and smelting factories. You 
hear rumours that there might be some worker exploitation going on.  
Some particularly vulnerable 
people are being mistreated. 
What are you going to do about 
it? 
6 
One industry (weaponry? transport) is taking all the metal products and other 
industries are suffering and unable to operate business. This is causing anger 
which could bubble over into street violence.  
This conflict is impinging on 
peaceful life within this 
settlement! 
7 
Fire has broken out, started from one of the forges. If not controlled, there 
could be huge damage, but what is it specifically that was being forged at the 
time? 
Adventurers to the rescue! 
8 
A bound elemental controlling a forge has escaped and is causing havoc. 
You may encounter this 
elemental on the street, or you 
may hear about it and be asked 
to help.

roaming free. It’s a wonder it hasn’t been shut down.

Public Square Table 
d12 
PUBLIC SQUARE DESCRIPTION 
NOTES 
1 
An expansive, neatly-paved square serves as the entrance point to a 
grand building (possibly a temple?) Several other impressive buildings 
surround this area, and there are notable other features present. 
Roll twice on Urban Landmark table.  
2 
This green square is a peaceful oasis, where trees provide shade and 
shelter from the elements. Citizens laze about on the grass, conversing, 
eating, playing music or reading tomes.  
Roll once on Urban Landmark table.  
3 
This windswept square is rather bleak, and people hurry to and fro with 
heads down. A garrison of soldiers is practicing forming ranks over one 
side, and several brutal-looking buildings surround this public square.  
Roll once on Urban Landmark table.  
4 
This busy, chaotic square seems to be a point of departure and arrival for 
the town. Many carriages are arrayed, all displaying different 
destinations across the realm on hand-painted signs. Various deals are 
being struck with farmers, miners and other new arrivals to the city.  
Roll once on Street Event table.  
5 
This square serves as a large courtyard for a royal or administrative 
building of some kind. There is a large podium set up with chairs 
arrayed. Is there a festival or something similar going on right now 
perhaps? 
Roll once on Street Event table, once 
on Urban Landmark table.  
6 
This square is stepped, as in there are different levels, and beautiful water 
features decorate each area. The engineering of these is interesting. 
There are many other features here too. It almost forms a kind of outdoor 
art exhibition. 
Roll once on Urban Landmark table. 
7 
This old square is in disrepair. Several ruined buildings stand around its 
edge, and the square itself has many places where the rubble is crumbling 
What’s lurking in those ruined 
buildings? Some of them might even 
be condemned.

and potholes have appeared. Perhaps this was the scene of a disaster of 
some kind.  
8 
There is a street that runs around the outside of this square, but the 
middle is a garden/common where creatures roam. It is [d4] (1-2) 
Overgrown (3-4) Neatly kept.  
What’s lurking in that garden? 
9 
This large square features a sunken amphitheatre at its centre where 
dramas are performed, night and day.  
What play is currently being 
performed? Some local legend, or 
perhaps a mythological tale of gods 
and fearsome beasts! 
10 
This large grassy square has a sizable pond at its centre. People throw 
coins in and make wishes. Some say that it’s quite deep and opens to a 
system of catacombs through a hidden cave. 
Roll once on Urban Landmark table. 
11 
A large, vast square with a temple, government buildings, and numerous 
prominent merchants. Adjust size according to settlement. If this is a 
metropolis, it could be massive, whereas if it’s a town it could measure 
four square blocks.  
Roll four times on Urban Landmark 
Table. For the businesses around the 
edge of this square, roll twice for each 
result and choose your preference.  
12 
A major, historically and culturally significant memorial / structure / 
landmark. 
Roll on Urban Landmark Table, but 
when generating results for this site 
keep in mind that it is a place of huge 
cultural importance. Perhaps use 
keywords and oracle rolls to 
determine the exact nature. 
 
Alleyway Table 
d8 
ALLEYWAY DESCRIPTION 
NOTES 
1 
A back entrance to a den of illicit activity.  
Roll on the Entertainment / Illicit industries table to find out 
the nature of this establishment.10% chance of a combat 
encounter with humanoids 
2 
This alleyway is a haven for thieves, 
pickpockets and assassins. It’s very likely 
there is a thieves’ guild nearby. 
30% chance of being pickpocketed, 20% chance of a random 
encounter with humanoids. 
3 
This is the back of a business selling food or 
meat, or a restaurant. 
You might be able to scavenge some food if you’re hungry. 
4 
Adjacent to residences. 
Reasonably well-kept. You see laundry strung out between 
porches and other domestic scenes. 
5 
Adjacent to a tavern 
Stumbling drunks, the occasional fight, people sleeping in the 
shadows. 
6 
Dilapidated, dark and wet. 
Is something sinister going on down here? Something hiding 
that’s escaped from the sewers? 10% chance of a combat 
encounter with a monstrosity or aberration. 
7 
Well-paved and maintained, a simple 
throughway between two streets. 
Possibly leading to a Commerce, Divine, Government or 
Scribes District.  
8 
A beautiful alleyway, architecturally 
constructed. 
Possibly with a notable feature such as a statue, fountain, shrine 
etc.

100 Quick Random Citizens Table 
Use these characters to quickly populate taverns, market squares and the like. Roll repeatedly for different results if you like, or just roll 
once and read straight across. Reroll if you don’t like a particular result or if it doesn’t make sense (a 256-year-old human, for example. 
Or, if you want to get really, deep, make some oracle rolls about why this human is so old. Vampire?). Also, roll a few keywords for a bit 
of flavour, if you like. It could produce a side quest or adventure seed!

Finding Items In Shops 
The two tables below allow you to determine, first of all, the quality of any given merchant, and 
second, whether you can find a particular item within their shop. A d20 roll on the Quality of Merchant 
Table will determine the quality of the merchant. Find your settlement (encampment, hamlet, village, 
town etc) in the top row, then roll a d20 in that column to determine their quality. Let’s say that you 
are in a city, trying to determine the quality of a weaponsmith’s shop. You roll a 10 on a d20, which 
determines that this merchant is of Fair quality. 
Now, let’s say you’re looking for a greatsword. Make a judgment here. A longsword is common, let’s 
say that a greatsword is uncommon. So, for a Fair merchant, the DC for finding an uncommon item is 
a 15 (on a d20). Your character’s skills don’t enter into the equation here, the merchant either has the 
item or they don’t. A 13 on a d20 determines they don’t have a greatsword! Perhaps they have a 
greataxe though. Repeat the roll for each item you’re looking for. And don’t get discouraged… 
maybe your quest to find a greatsword will lead you to meet an interesting NPC… perhaps go to a 
blacksmith’s and get them to forge you one with some special details in the crafting, to make it 
unique to your character. Just like a group game, small things like this can provide flavour within a 
solo quest.

chance the tunnel continues on the other side. 
3-4 
Chasm drops down 1d10 x 10 feet.  
Drops into a [d10] (1-4) Tunnel (5-8) Cavern (9-10) 
Underground lake. Roll 1d4 times on the Features table. 50% 
chance the tunnel continues on the other side. 
5-6 
Chasm drops down 1d20 x 10 feet.  
Drops into a [d10] (1-4) Tunnel (5-8) Cavern (9-10) 
Underground lake. Roll 1d4 times on the Features table. 50% 
chance the tunnel continues on the other side. 
7-8 
Chasm disappears out of sight 
Who knows what’s down there? You cannot see the bottom. 
Even for characters with darkvision, it is beyond your sight. 
Roll 1d2 times on the Features table for your immediate 
surroundings. Reroll if the result is not appropriate. 50% 
chance the tunnel continues on the other side. 
9 
You are about halfway down the chasm. 
Looking up, you see that it reaches up 1d10 x 
10 feet and is possibly climbable (Athletics 
check?). It also drops 1d10 x 10 feet.  
Above, you can see [d10] (1-3) Open sky (4-6) Ledges, off of 
which run tunnels (7-8) Not much, just a chasm rising up, but 
there might be something up there (9-10) Some sort of colony, 
burrows or even structures on the chasm walls. Roll 1d4 times 
on the Features table. 
50% chance the tunnel continues on the other side. 
10 
You are at the bottom of the chasm, the floor of 
which forms a tunnel that seems to go a long 
way into the earth. Looking up, you see that it 
reaches up 1d20 x 10 feet and is possibly 
climbable (Athletics check?).  
Treat this chasm floor as a tunnel, and roll on the Tunnel table.

Chapter 2-3 
Castle Generator 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Often we find ourselves, in the course of 
overland adventuring, coming across a castle or 
stronghold which must be explored. Use the 
tables in this chapter to flesh out your random 
castle. This generator is organized a little bit 
differently, as will be explained below. 
 
How to Proceed 
To use this generator, do these things, in 
order.  
1. Roll on all the tables in Part One: 
Approaching the Castle.  
2. Then, find the appropriate set of tables for 
your Castle Size Value (determined below). 
These are what you will roll on as you 
move through the castle. 
 
CSV: Castle Size Value 
This is a numeric value, generated by a d4 roll 
on a table below, that will determine various 
aspects of the locations you encounter within 
the castle.  
 
Encounters While in the 
Castle 
The nature of any encounters that occur while 
you are present in the castle very much depends 
on whether the castle is in use or abandoned. If 
the castle is in use (as in, the lord of the castle is 
present, along with his family, retainers, 
servants, guards etc) then you will probably be 
escorted through the castle, rather than being 
allowed to roam freely (unless you have entered 
by stealth and are trying to not be detected). If, 
however, the castle is abandoned, then it has 
probably been re-populated by monsters.  
So, take one of the following approaches: 
• 
If the castle is in use: use oracle rolls to 
determine who is in which rooms and 
who you encounter.  
• 
If the castle is abandoned: use the 6d12 
system to determine what you find in 
each room (see Chapter 1-4). 
 
 
 
Random & Set Locations 
You will notice a column entitled Set Locations 
on many of the tables in this chapter. Set 
Locations are features that are definitely present 
and is based on your Castle Size Value. When 
you roll on the appropriate tables, you will have 
a choice of encountering a Random Location, or 
choosing a Set Location. Make a note of 
locations as you encounter them. Remember 
that, for things like bedrooms, latrines etc, 
there will usually be more than one, especially 
in a large castle.  
 
Mapping 
Mapping your castle will help you to remember 
the locations of different areas as you move 
through, so you can return to them later if need 
be, and so you can see which locations you have 
already encountered. 
 
Inside the Bailey / Inside 
the Castle 
Once you enter through the gates of a castle, 
the first table you will roll on will be the Inside 
the Bailey table for your particular CSV. When 
you progress into the keep proper, you will roll 
on the Inside the Castle (tiers 1-3) tables. 
 
Tiers 
The rooms within the castle are organized by 
tiers. Tiers do not represent levels of the castle, 
but rather a hierarchical structure. For 
example, Tier 1 rooms include things like the 
throne room and banquet hall.  
Tier 2 rooms are the “behind-the-scenes” type 
rooms and include the kitchen, pantry, 
storeroom and other things that assist in the 
everyday running of the castle. 
Tier 3 rooms are the private rooms of the 
inhabitants of the castle and may include 
bedrooms, bathrooms, latrine, study, servant’s 
quarters etc. 
When leaving certain rooms, there is 
sometimes an opportunity given to move to a 
different tier, usually via a staircase. Keep an 
eye out for these rolls.

Progressing through 
rooms 
The following rooms may connect directly to 
each other via doors, or they may be linked via 
straight hallways. I’ve taken the approach here 
of having the different tiers separated by floors, 
but they don’t need to be.  
 
Number of Rooms per 
Level 
The bottom level of the castle, which we will 
call level 1, will usually have more rooms than 
the upper levels, which generally consist of 
towers and thus less rooms.  
The basement level might have quite a few 
levels, however.

Part One: Approaching the Castle 
 
Castle Location 
Obviously, the castle’s location will depend on the environment you are currently travelling through, 
but here is a bit of localised flavour to give your castle come character. 
 
The castle is situated... 
d10 CASTLE LOCATION 
1 
On a slight rise, surrounded by boulders. 
2 
On the side of a river, with trees nearby. 
3 
At the edge of a forest. 
4 
In the middle of a wetland, reached by a causeway.  
5 
On the far side of a ravine, reached by a bridge. 
6 
Near an open area where you can see burial mounds. 
7 
Beside a picturesque lake surrounded by forest. 
8 
At the base of a towering cliff or mountain. 
9 
Atop a high, rocky outcrop or hill, and perhaps surrounded by forest. 
10 
Just outside a town, and surrounded by farmland. 
 
Castle Size Value (CSV) 
Approaching the castle, you see that it is… 
In addition to the description given on the table below, check the GM’s Miscellany Wilderness Dressing 
resource (pp.8-15) for some fantastic castle dressing resources.  
This roll is important as the d4 result is now your CSV or Castle Size Value. This will determine 
many aspects of your castle moving forward. Take note of this value.

Chapter 3-1  
Wilderness Encounters 
 
This chapter contains an all-new list of random non-combat wilderness encounters for you to use in 
your solo adventures. Many of these can function as adventure seeds also. 
 
When to use these?  
• 
As an alternative to the tables in TSAT 1  
• 
When an oracle triggers it (such as when you roll doubles in Mythic).  
• 
When your adventure has stalled and you need something to get it going again. 
• 
When you’re in the wilderness and a system tells you to roll a random encounter  
 
Never let the rules of a solo system stand in the way of creating engaging action. If nothing is 
happening, make something happen (unless your characters want downtime).   
If you do not like the result you have rolled, simply roll again. These are adventuring aids, not rules. 
 
d100 RESULT 
1 
You find an assortment of personal possessions in this area. Roll 5 times on the Items table 
(p.163), ignoring natural results such as rubble, leaves etc. Only things that would have 
reasonably been possessions. 
2 
A large number of birds have amassed in an area ahead. Enough to make you wonder why 
they are all there, filling every tree branch, perched on every boulder and available 
surface...  
3 
You meet a local hunter setting traps in the area. She has some interesting information to 
relate regarding things she has seen in her travels.  
4 
A malevolent, treacherous energy lurks in this area. The god of trickery is worming his 
way into the minds of all. If you have any sidekicks with you, or if there is more than one 
PC in your party, then have either a sidekick, PC or NPC make a Wisdom saving throw. If 
they fail, they turn on your main character, attacking them with their most powerful attack. 
The effect ceases as soon as this sidekick, PC or NPC either takes damage, or has a spell 
such as remove curse cast on them. You could also play it like this: have your main PC make 
a Wisdom save, and if they fail, they attack the NPC/sidekick.  
5 
An NPC (roll on NPC tables if you desire, or simply decide their characteristics) catches up 
with you and begins asking all sorts of questions. “Where are you coming from? Have you 
any tales to tell? What is your profession?” They come across as very eager and interested. 
You’re not sure if they have any motives… perhaps they have just been without company 
for some time. 
6 
You come across a section of forest that has been destroyed. A druid is in the process of 
casting plant growth on various small plants to re-vegetate the area. 
7 
You come across an abandoned cabin, its door hanging off the hinges. Belongings are 
scattered everywhere. There are traces of blood to be found, but no creatures in sight. 
8 
You pass a small inn. A wealthy noblewoman, just passing through, has stopped here and is 
buying everyone drinks. It seems she has had great luck in business recently.

9 
A local wizard is accepting visitors to his tower - a group of apprentices from a local 
alchemy school, who have come to hear a lecture from him on the creation of exotic 
potions. 
10 
A cart passes, being driven by a figure in a hood who does not address you in any way or 
even look up from the reins. In the back are various cages and crates. Two of them are 
covered with thick canvasses, and from within you hear a strange, feral barking and 
yowling. There are creatures of some kind in there, but you don’t know exactly what 
species.  
11 
A group of pilgrims are on a walking journey towards a temple no-one in the party has 
heard of. They have been walking for some months already, picking up people along the 
way. 
12 
You see a wanted poster. A notorious criminal is in the area. 10% chance it is someone you 
know (NPC or even someone in the party). 
13 
You come across an ancient fortress that has been inhabited by a group of opportunistic 
humanoids. They are currently practicing combat manoeuvres and preparing for 
something. You are a little way off and they have not seen you (yet) but it appears 
preparations are underway for some kind of combat action.  
14 
Roll a d4. (1) The air crackles with some unknown energy (2) The ground shakes (3) An 
ominous peal of thunder resounds in the sky (4) The sun turns a dark shade of red. 
Ominous portents all point towards some cataclysmic event. You don’t know what it is, but 
in your soul, you feel as if something momentous has just happened or is about to happen. 
15 
Make a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. If unsuccessful, you fail to notice a [d6] (1-2) 
Rope trap (3-4) Net trap (5-6) Pit trap which you blunder into. Moments later, cultists 
emerge from the undergrowth and secure you in ropes. They will try to convert you to 
their beliefs as part of an aggressive recruitment drive! They have already captured a dozen 
or so people in this way. You will be subject to enchantment spells and may actually 
succumb to believing their philosophy, at least for a while. 
16 
You see [d4] rangers who look like they are hot on the trial of something or someone. 
They stop, crouching to the ground and examining signs in the dirt.  
17 
The smell of yeast and hops is heavy in the air. You emerge in a smallish open area where a 
neatly-kept building stands beside a babbling brook. Dwarves and halflings are hard at 
work, milling about this building and performing various jobs. A sign on the outside reads 
“Stoutfolk Brewery.” (Or perhaps you’d rather come up with your own name!)  
18 
A shooting pain stabs through your head, nay, your very soul! You feel as though someone 
is trying to control your mind with magic, or targeting you with some kind of psychic 
attack. 
19 
You come across a merchant who is deep in haggling with a nobleman. The nobleman is 
demanding that the merchant sell him some rare item the merchant has in their possession, 
but the merchant is not budging, insisting that it is not for sale. The nobleman is getting 
rather hot under the collar. What is this item that has them so fired up? 
20 
You enter an area where a gallows has been erected. A small crowd has gathered to witness 
the execution of a monk who has been accused of spying on the local authorities for some 
rival nation or faction.  
21 
A robbery has been foiled! Highwaymen are lying prone and bound at the side of the road, 
and a group of passengers have disembarked from an ornate-looking carriage and are

preparing to dispense some brutal justice to these unfortunate criminals. The carriage 
driver and a slightly-dishevelled looking nobleman, bearing cudgels, have somehow got the 
upper hand. 
22 
Something is approaching. You hear [d6] (1-2) The tread of many feet, as of an army (3-4) 
A heavy tread, as of a large creature (5-6) The patter of many tiny feet, a large group of 
smaller creatures. You will have time to hide and watch them go by with a successful DC 
10 Dexterity (Stealth) check. 
23 
You chance upon a network of caves that look like they could have once been inhabited by a 
tribe of humanoids.  
24 
You come across two carts which have collided badly. One of the carts overturned and 
spilled its contents across the road, and now the owner of the goods is having a tantrum 
and demanding the other cart driver pay for the ruined goods. However, as this is 
happening, their argument is interrupted by a dull roar from something nearby...  
25 
A ruined hut is here, with its roof partially caved in. 
26-
30 
Roll a d4. (1-2) Roll on Skill Challenge table (p.139) (3-4) Level-appropriate easy encounter 
31 
A piece of parchment is stuck into a tree with a dagger. The parchment is scrawled with 
messy writing that looks like it was written by a child. It reads: “You are entering the 
republic of the Forsaken Ones. All who wander in here without proper consent are 
trespassing and will be dealt with harshly.” 
32 
You come across an ancient cemetery. All the gravestones are neglected bar one which has 
had the weeds cleared from around it and fresh flowers placed before it.  
33 
Perched on the edge of a cliff overlooking a small lake, a dilapidated castle, its walls 
crumbling in places, lies ahead.  
34 
A patrol from a nearby town is halted by the road, their cart having gotten stuck in a 
muddy rut. They impolitely demand that you assist them in getting the stuck vehicle free. 
“As a citizen of this realm, it is your civic duty to assist us!” 
35 
A rustle in some bushes ahead and some easily overheard conversation gives away the 
position of some juvenile criminals (from a nearby village/town?) planning to ambush a 
passing cart.  
36 
You come to the top of a gully, thick with vegetation. The sound of drums drifts up to you 
and smoke from numerous fires rises in plumes above the forest canopy below. Every now 
and then you hear chanting, different songs, sometimes a dozen or so voices joined as one.   
37 
Making your way through a patch of dense undergrowth, you find a concealed tomb, 
covered in vines and creepers. Nature has begun reclaiming this forgotten structure, and all 
signs of who previously inhabited it are gone. Ripping away foliage, you find a stone door. 
38 
You are approaching a grove of trees (or a clearing if you are in a forest) and can see a 
group of people assembled there. One figure in robes stands before them, and appears to be 
chanting a litany of some kind. The others repeat the words in a ritualistic fashion. 
39 
Several wizards are here, surrounding a swirling field of energy, attempting to control it. 
They do not notice your presence, too busy are they with this desperate work! This is some 
sort of extra-dimensional energy, trying to enter this world...

40 
You are approaching a large castle or fortress of some kind. It appears a small military 
force is arrayed outside its walls, laying siege to the place.  
41 
A band of clerics and monks is tending to what appears to be a huge throng of displaced 
refugees. Food is being served from huge pots to an endless queue of people. What is their 
story, how were they forced out of their home, and where will they go from here? 
42 
High above you see a flying craft, either magical or created using some unknown 
technology, pass overhead. Where is it heading? 
43 
Suddenly a group of humanoids passes you. Halflings or gnomes, intent on something and 
all bearing weapons, are marching purposefully towards some unknown destination. Every 
now and then, one particularly angry one at the head of the party yells “Come on boys, 
time for some payback eh?” To which the others all roar in approval.  
44 
You are approached by a group of fey creatures. “Please, we need your help, we’re at our 
wits end! Our village is being attacked!”  
45 
A patch of large fungi is ahead. These strange growths appear to be dripping with a violet 
sap. Looking closer, you see that where this sap has landed on the ground, it has killed 
everything growing there. It appears to be a virulent poison. 
46 
You come across an enchanted glade, an oasis of some kind. Clear blue water falls from 
above into a serene pond with a sound like the tinkling of crystals, and trees bearing sweet-
smelling flowers arc out over the water, occasionally dropping delicate blooms onto the 
water’s surface. It is almost too beautiful to be believed... 
47 
A huge boom, like an explosion, comes from somewhere ahead, perhaps a few miles. It is so 
massive that you feel the vibration through the earth. What is it? A meteor? A volcano? A 
powerful spell? The only way to find out is to go and investigate. 
48 
A mansion, the estate of some noble who apparently likes to be away from civilisation, lies 
ahead. The gates to the place are guarded. 
49 
The moon is high in the sky (whether day or night) but does not appear as normal. Roll a 
d4. (1) It is a different colour (2) A huge chunk has been blasted off by a comet or 
something similar, which looks epic but is rather worrying (3) It appears closer than 
normal (4) It is in a phase that it shouldn’t be.  
50 
A group of soldiers and nobles are supervising a book burning.  
51-
55 
Roll a d4. (1-2) Roll on Boon table (p.152) (3-4) Level-appropriate medium encounter 
56 
You enter a copse of trees. Then, in the midst of this small, dense wood, you come across 
several carved symbols of various gods, some festooned with cobwebs, others kept clean 
and orderly with fresh offerings before them. 
57 
You come across a travelling salesman who deals exclusively in exotic beasts that he keeps 
in cages. His cart is loaded with them! Perhaps you think him cruel, and no doubt there is 
an element of cruelty here. But more worrying is the fact that he has gathered all these 
strange animals together in one place. What would happen if one or more of them were to 
somehow get free? 
58 
 “Friend!” a voice addresses you from somewhere. “Want to make some money? I need a 
hand with something. I promise it will be worth your while...” This ragged-looking 
individual has a story to tell. Use random keywords or event meaning tables (or both) to 
determine what work he is proposing.

59 
A pair of warriors, utterly spent and bloodied, lie panting after a ferocious duel. They 
appear to have been fighting each other all day but are too evenly matched, and neither can 
get the upper hand. Perhaps you can mediate in this situation. But first, you’ll need to 
understand their dispute. Keywords! 
60 
A wide river is ahead, and a large band of workers (probably from a nearby settlement) are 
creating a dam wall.  
61 
A garishly-coloured bird alights in a nearby tree and regards you with a gaze that is 
distinctly un-birdlike. “Hmm,” it says, looking you up and down. “Intriguing.” 
62 
You arrive at a rope bridge which extends over a narrow but deep canyon. However, you 
are hesitant. The rope looks old and frayed, and you are unsure if it will hold. 
63 
A lone figure is slumped against a tree sobbing. “My master is dead,” they sob.   
64 
You reach the top of a low cliff where you are looking down into what appears to be a 
quarry. Several ogres are here, bearing whips and other weapons, and are putting a variety 
of humanoids to work, using them as slaves to mine this area. 
65 
You hear a chorus of soft, melodious voices calling to you from nearby, beckoning you to 
come closer. The words are almost formed as a song.  
66 
You meet an adventurer, on their way to explore a famed local ruins. Roll on NPC tables 
(or choose a random, level-appropriate sidekick) and generate a dungeon-based quest using 
either Chapter 7 of TSAT 1 or any of the quest generation tools in this book. If you wish to 
pursue this thread, you must take this NPC with you as they are the one who is on this 
quest. You are accompanying them.  
67 
The foliage suddenly becomes lush and thick in this area. It is a little out of place, and 
seems to have sprung up unnaturally, as if the result of some kind of natural magic.  
68 
You pass a cave in a low cliff. Someone has fitted a door over the entrance. Has it been 
turned into a dwelling of some sort? Or, perhaps they merely wanted to restrict entrance. 
69 
You pass rocks that have strange markings on them, that look to be from the earliest 
humanoid civilization that populated these lands. A DC 14 History check will enable you to 
determine their basic meaning. Otherwise, who knows what they speak of... 
70 
A storm approaches from the [d4] (1) Northern (2) Southern (3) Eastern (4) Western 
horizon. You fancy you can see the shapes of various creatures within it. Ominous, dark 
grey and laced with lightning, it is approaching fast!  
71 
The sound of fighting nearby, the vibration of heavy footfalls felt through the ground - it 
seems like two huge creatures of some description are going at it, fighting to the death! 
72 
A disembodied voice speaks to you directly. Roll on event meaning tables or keywords list 
to discover what this supernatural voice says to you. 
73 
An absolutely vile smell reaches your nostrils, coming from the [d4] (1) North (2) South 
(3) East (4) West. It smells like [d4] (1) Rotting corpses (2) Unwashed bodies (3) Spoiled 
Food (4) Excrement. 
74 
As you watch, you see something shimmer into view, as if teleported from somewhere else. 
What is it that you see? [d10]  
(1-2) Interesting natural landscape feature (3-4) NPC (5-6) Structure (7-8) Vehicle (9-10) 
Something else (roll on Keywords table, p.167).

A marked change in elevation is causing the land to slope upwards towards a plateau. 
Several tracks wind their way up towards the summit of this elevation, which should afford 
a good view of the surrounding terrain.  
82 
A travelling apothecary is offering strange herbal remedies with a variety of outlandish 
effects. Use keywords to determine the nature of these effects. 
83 
The landscape on the side of a gently-sloping hill has been marked with white chalk to 
resemble the outline of a beast. This land carving may have been here for millennia. 
84 
Steam is rising from a hot springs ahead. You hear conversation also. (Roll for 1d4+1 
NPCs relaxing here, using the NPC tables in TSAT 1).  
85 
More and more, you notice that the wildlife in this area - birds, deer, insects, small 
creatures of all descriptions - appear to have been magically altered. At first it starts with 
differences in colouration, but then progresses to mismatched body parts and then totally 
hybrid creatures. What is causing this anomaly?  
86 
You reach a low hill - or is it a structure of some kind - which appears to be entirely formed 
of [d4] (1) Glass (2) Steel (3) Gemstone (too hard to mine) (4) Some other non-precious 
mineral. 
87 
These rocks look strange here, out of place, and not fitting with the geology of the area. 
Not only that, there is a curious pattern of spirals covering them which you cannot initially 
see the purpose of. 
88 
A geyser is erupting clouds of poisonous steam into the air. You may want to avoid this 
area. However, you see activity going on there… are there creatures living here, even 
subsisting off these fumes? 
89 
A patrol from a nearby town is set up here in a roadside booth. Several carts are pulled up 
and are being inspected for stolen or smuggled goods and contraband.  
90 
You meet a lone NPC on your route. They are a bit confused and keep repeating the same 
phrase over and over again. “It must never be allowed to happen. It must never be allowed 
to happen.” Over and over. 
91 
Overhead, you see some sort of astronomical portent. [d4] (1) Comet (2) Meteor shower 
(3) Eclipse (4) Day or night suddenly appears, no matter what the time. The 
scriptures/prophecies of old spoke of this, and what it signified... 
92 
Ahead, you see what appears to be a large walled garden of some kind. A construct stands 
guard outside it, unmoving. What type of construct is it? [d6] (1) Animated armour (2) 
Stone defender (3) Shield guardian (4) Clay golem (5) Stone golem (6) Iron golem. 
93 
A crow flies overhead, and drops a scroll in your path, then turns and departs in an eastern 
direction. The scroll bears a different message relevant to the quest you are on.  
Or, if you prefer, the scroll reads as follows:  
Adventurer! Heed my call! I am in need of your services. Head east, until you see a great tower, with 
a sigil marking in its door. That is where I reside. I have a proposition for you. 
94 
You come across a large rock. The top half of this rock has been carved into the likeness of 
a local renowned deity, but the carving is only half-finished and the bottom half of the rock

is still in its natural state. It appears this work was abandoned halfway through. Coming 
closer, you notice that the carver’s tools are still there, scattered on the ground amidst rock 
chippings. 
95 
You encounter an open-air forge in the middle of this wilderness. There is a hut nearby, 
and 1d4 burly blacksmiths are forging weapons, domestic items, building materials, 
smelting iron, copper, many different metals, and generally just doing blacksmith stuff.

Chapter 3-2 
Urban Encounters 
 
This chapter contains an all-new list of random non-combat urban encounters for you to use in your 
solo adventures. Many of these can function as adventure seeds also. 
 
When to use these?  
• 
As an alternative to the tables in TSAT 1  
• 
When an oracle triggers it (such as when you roll doubles in Mythic).  
• 
When your adventure has stalled and you need something to get it going again. 
• 
When you’re in a city or other settlement and a system tells you to roll a random encounter  
 
Never let the rules of a solo system stand in the way of creating engaging action. If nothing is 
happening, make something happen (unless your characters want downtime).   
If you do not like the result you have rolled, simply roll again. These are adventuring aids, not rules. 
 
 
d100 RESULT 
1 
 You hear rumours of a nomadic cult that has taken up residence in an abandoned building 
in a deserted part of town. Who knows what they are planning, but there are strange 
sounds and lights coming from that area. 
2 
A strongman is exhibiting a show of strength at the side of the street, and has drawn a 
large crowd. However, this burly character looks dejected, exhausted, and the announcer 
who is narrating his feats appears to be the one in control. Does he have the poor brute 
magically enslaved? Or is some other form of duress going on here? 
3 
A guard patrol suddenly runs past you. “To the gates, to the gates!” they are yelling. “We 
are being attacked!”  
4 
 You pass a market stall. The stallholder is being harassed by someone in a loud voice. “I 
know you have it, you liar! Give it to me now!” 
5 
Looking down an alleyway, you can see a figure being set upon by three larger individuals - 
this definitely does not seem to be a fair fight...  
6 
Some sort of coloured smoke is billowing out of the windows of a nearby building! Some 
sort of alchemical chaos perhaps? Or something else... 
7 
“Accepting all comers!” a huge bugbear yells as he walks down the street, ringing a hand 
bell. “Tonight, at the Ancient Chalice! Pit fights, only the dirtiest, meanest fighters will 
survive. 500 gold prize money! We’ll take anyone!” 
8 
You pass a row of abandoned multi-storey buildings, each one with parchment nailed to the 
front door. They all read the same: Condemned. Do not enter. 
9 
A large, walled urban garden is here. The sign outside informs you that the garden holds 
some extremely rare and exotic species.  
10 
An old man telling a story has gathered a large group of children and adults around him, 
entranced by his narration. It seems he was a former adventurer and has some enthralling 
tales to tell.

11 
A streetside merchant is selling baubles, inside which strange colours and scenes are 
swirling. He tells you that at the right phase of the moon, you can enter one of these 
baubles as a small pocket dimension, which you can shape to your liking. He’s asking 500gp 
for each of them. But there is an element of shadiness to this merchant and you perhaps 
don’t trust him...  
12 
A local artist is exhibiting works in a gallery. Visitors have reported that his images are so 
dark and evocative that he must have had some horrific experiences. It’s even said that 
some descend into madness after viewing these works. Whatever the case, the exhibition 
seems to be attracting a lot of attention.    
13 
A cart passes by, built of wood and metal, with bars over the windows. Passers-by remark 
that it is an infamous criminal, finally caught, who is being transported to the town jail. 
“They never thought they’d catch him,” someone says. “He’s been eluding them for years!” 
14 
Someone is tolling the alarm bell nearby. Has a fire broken out? Magical chaos? Some sort 
of catastrophe has occurred that is serious enough to call the town guard over.  
15 
You pass a huge, sprawling graveyard, covering a large area. All the town’s dead are buried 
here, and it’s said that some tombs connect to a deeper network of catacombs. Currently, 
however, a crowd is gathered around a freshly-dug grave where a recently-deceased local 
identity is being interred. This person, you hear someone nearby remark, died in extremely 
mysterious circumstances. There are many unanswered questions... 
16 
You pass a magician’s guildhall. It is very active at the moment - a steady stream of mages 
is coming and going from the door. Inquiring of one of them, you are informed that this 
guildhall is currently hosting the annual general meeting to discuss the state of magic in 
the realm.  
17 
A royal procession is about to begin. The Queen/King/Emperor/Empress is due to pass 
along the street you are on with their entourage very shortly. You see the town guard 
doing a preliminary sweep of buildings, checking for potential assassins or evil-doers. 
“Make way!” someone shouts. “Make way for our glorious ruler!” Adults and children alike 
are beginning to throng either side of the street in anticipation of the regal parade.  
18 
Striking up a conversation with a local, you are told of the old town, a deserted, partially 
ruined quarter that was recently overrun by monsters. Much slaughter and devastation 
happened there. “No-one ventures there now,” the local informs you. “It’s said that there 
are still horrors lurking there, waiting for the foolish to venture in.” 
19 
You catch a snatch of conversation from two passing locals. “I overheard them talking 
about it in The Gobbling Gander. Yes, a heist, planned for tonight! The Guild of 
Scoundrels has never been so daring as to attempt something like this!” 
20 
A small temple is having a festival which involves a bizarre tradition. [d4] (1) Feeding all 
passers-by, regardless of religion, until they are so full, they can barely move (2) Treating 
all visitors to the temple like royalty, washing their feet, massaging their shoulders and 
generally pampering them (3) Hurling insults at people passing by the temple (4) Allowing 
the children to order the adults about and treat them like slaves for a day.  
After this tradition is observed, it is customary for a high-ranking priest to tell a story 
about their god or goddess’s mythology.  
21 
You pass a grand building under construction. Teams of dwarven stonemasons are crafting 
this building, working many intricate details into the masonry. Each of the carvings has a 
story behind it, as the foreman is only too eager to inform you. This building is going to be 
[d4] (1) An embassy for the dwarven kingdom of _____ (2) An urban residence for a

dwarven ruler (3) a temple to a prominent dwarven god (4) A grand tomb, commissioned 
by the devoted followers of a noted dwarven priest or mage. 
22 
You begin seeing a poster issuing a reward for a notorious criminal. The thing is, this 
criminal bears a striking resemblance to a member of your adventuring party! 
23 
A duel is about to take place, in the middle of the street / town square / market between 
two rival mages. By all indications, it’s going to get ugly! 
24 
There is a commodity shortage in this part of town (e.g., food/water/building supplies). 
Perhaps the local government has placed restrictions on this area because of perceived 
unlawful behaviour, but whatever the case, the citizenry is on the brink of rioting.  
25 
 Since you’ve been in this town, you’ve noticed quite a few suspicious-looking individuals 
all sporting the same tattoo. You wonder what it could signify.  
26-
30 
Roll a d4. (1-2) Roll on Skill Challenge table, p.139 (3-4) Level-appropriate easy encounter 
31 
A noble passes in a litter carried by servants. “Get out of the way, filthy peasants!” the 
noble rudely shouts as the litter jostles past.  
32 
You hear that a huge ship has just arrived in port from a foreign land. No-one has ever 
encountered these peoples before, and they are looking to make contact with locals to learn 
more about local customs and culture. They also brought some fascinating items with them 
to trade.  
33 
A violent gang conflict (perhaps between two rival thieves’ guilds or other factions) has 
spilled out into the streets. It’s open warfare out here, with abductions and assassinations 
happening in broad daylight. 
34 
From a second-story window, you hear a halfling woman singing a pretty song about an 
ancient hero and their conquests. The story is very descriptive, and you are perhaps 
overcome with a desire to know more about this legend.   
35 
A worried-looking novice mage is making their way down the street carrying an armful of 
scrolls. “Can’t be late!” she is saying to herself. “Mistress will kill me if I’m late! If only I 
had someone to help me with these scrolls!” 
36 
You see an agile figure bounding across rooftops, carrying something. From quite a way 
behind, pursuers are yelling at them to stop.  
37 
An eviction is in progress. You see the town guard forcibly removing a family and their 
grandfather from their house. A woman is screaming: “This is a disgrace! Do you know 
who my father is? You have no respect! Wait till the duke hears about this, he’ll have your 
heads!” 
38 
There is a crack of thunder and rain begins falling very heavily. Stall holders and other 
vendors begin packing up, and citizens doing their business about town begin running for 
cover. It is an absolute downpour. You see a nearby tavern which looks cosy and inviting.  
39 
This area of the town is deserted… every house barred, condemned. Then you see them, 
piled up in the middle of a square. Bodies. A tolling bell catches your attention. “Bring out 
yer dead!” 
40 
You see a man running, looking terrified, clutching a relic of some kind. Then, some 
distance behind him, a mob of well-armed female priests.

41 
A desperate-looking half-elf peasant clutching a pitchfork asks you if you’ve seen anyone 
who looks like him pass by recently. He refuses to explain or give his name. 
42 
A guard checkpoint stops everyone except a noble and his entourage. 
43 
You hear word that a ship’s captain is sitting in a nearby tavern, looking for adventurers to 
accompany him as protection on his next expedition to the outer islands. The pay is terrible 
and the food worse, but he promises one thing: it won’t be boring. 
44 
An exhibition is in town featuring artifacts from far-flung countries that most people have 
never heard of. 
45 
Passing an open doorway, you catch a strange scent, and cannot help but glimpse several 
drowsy-looking people stumbling between rooms. A female, seated by the door, notices 
your interest. “Fancy a taste?” she asks. “Go see Delren in the back room, he’ll sort you 
out.” 
46 
A warrior stumbles out of an alleyway into the middle of the street, a sword impaling him 
from front to back. “Stop… him…” he manages to say before collapsing onto his knees. He 
is alive, but only barely.  
47 
A wizard is casting divination spells at passers-by and then tossing off idle remarks about 
the person’s future.  
48 
“Be on the lookout,” a small company of guards is announcing loudly as they patrol the 
streets. “Prisoners escaped from the tower!” 
49 
You see a poster. The local library is getting overstocked and is having a sale of some of its 
books. Some old books of redundant maps that no-one uses anymore (as they refer to the 
ancient kingdom, not the current one) and other potentially interesting but obscure tomes 
are being sold for a fairly reasonable price (100-300 gp per book. depending on rarity).  
50 
You spy a large building ahead which is subject to some strange metaphysical anomaly. 
[d4] (1) The building floats (2) The building is covered by a dark shroud resembling 
night-time (3) The building is surrounded by light patterns (4) The building is partially 
spectral (transparent) and you can see its interior.

Roll a d4. (1-2) Roll on Boon table, p.152 (3-4) Level-appropriate medium encounter.

A young woman is passing out wooden tokens for a free drink at a local tavern. 
57 
A boat is passing in a nearby canal. It is [d4] (1) A royal barge (2) A goods freighter (3) A 
pirate or explorer vessel of some description (4) A mage’s ship. If the city is landlocked, 
make it an airship instead.  
58 
If you have an NPC or sidekick, they are potentially kidnapped by a group of thugs while 
you are distracted. You could choose this to happen to your PC instead, or your party could 
witness a kidnapping. 
59 
You see workers loading a huge shipment into boats, or into carts if your settlement is 
landlocked. You wonder what this shipment is, where it might be going, what it is, who it’s 
for and whether they have protection on the journey.  
60 
A section of street has fallen into a sinkhole deep below, taking several houses with it. Who 
knows why this happened, but it is unlikely that the inhabitants of the houses survived.

61 
You pass a place of business where many vehicles are parked outside. (These could be any 
sort of vehicle that fits with the lore of your world, from an oxcart to an airship). They are 
offering passage to most major settlements in the realm. Fares start at 50 gp. 
62 
The panicked news comes to you through the city grapevine, and people are fleeing to 
safety as a result. A famous local wizard, finally driven insane through his dabblings in 
obscure subject areas, is on a rampage through the city, destroying everything in his path. 
Authorities are unsure how to deal with him.  
63 
A stranger runs quickly past you, dropping a random item in your path. [d4] (1) Mundane 
Item (Roll on Item table, p.163, until you get something that fits context) [2] Weapon [3] 
Gems and money (roll on CR 1 hoard table, DMG or TSAT) [4] Common magic item. 
64 
The street suddenly goes empty but for one or two people, and in the next moment even 
they are gone. You are alone… Where did everyone go? Then you hear it... 
65 
A poster announces the public reading of an obscure and arcane scroll recently discovered 
by an eminent archaeologist in a forgotten tomb near to the city. 
66 
A huge team of workers is busy fixing this part of town. It turns out that this area of the 
city houses catacombs which connect to the Underdark, through long networks of twisting 
passages. Somehow, a purple worm found its way up here and burst through the surface, 
destroying huge amounts of masonry, businesses, residences, ploughing through several 
blocks of buildings. The damage was immeasurable and will take months to repair. Also, a 
small company of men-at-arms is stationed there in case any other nasties come up from 
below... 
67 
News comes to you of beggars and homeless being killed by some unknown terror... 
68 
A creature begins following you. [d10] (1-8) Beast, (9) Construct (10) Other. Choose a 
level-appropriate creature familiar from SRD Monsters, Monster Manual or other 
resource.     
69 
A large government building has a crowd protesting outside of it. They could be from a 
peoples who have been mistreated by the ruling elite. But this is a situation that you know 
of and has been going on in the realm for years. Decades, even.  
70 
This part of town bears some interesting ancient hieroglyphs etched on various historical 
walls. Some of them are in a language that no-one has been able to decipher.  
71 
To their great surprise, one of your PCs sees someone from their old home town. This 
NPC shares news of their hometown, as well as gibing access to some local networks. 
72 
You run into an NPC from a previous adventure. Perhaps they were evil and mended their 
ways (or perhaps not), but anyway they have some interesting stories to tell. 
73 
You see an artisan sitting outside their workshop, finishing off some incredibly detailed 
work while an apprentice looks on.  
74 
Two expert swordmasters are duelling it out in a public place. The exhibition has drawn a 
crowd, but no mistake - this is a fight to the death, as evidenced by the expressions of 
determination on the faces of the competitors.  
75 
You hear a voice in your head. “Do not be alarmed. I speak to you because I can, and 
because I have seen you before. I do so through magic, but also because I need your 
services. Come to me at the Inn of the Three Wands. It is hard to find, but you shall know 
the way. If you do not wish to, forget I have spoken to you and continue on your way. I 
shall not bother you again. But I promise you, it will be worth your while.”

81 
You encounter a circus performing in a large plaza. Acrobats, jesters, storytellers, 
puppeteers, illusionists, all manner of entertainers are here, and many interesting market 
stalls to boot.  
82 
A trio of interesting-looking individuals - adventurers perhaps - blinks into view right in 
front of you. “What… where are we?” one of them stammers.  
83 
Two halfling women, one old and one young, are walking past you. “It’s all right mother,” 
the young one says. “It’s only for a little while. The locket should get us a nice purse of 
gold, then we can be back under a roof before nightfall.” 
The older one sobs. “That heartless wretch! Casting us out on the street like stray dogs! 
That locket belonged to my grandmother!” 
84 
The local botanic gardens are a fascinating place. There is a section of the garden where 
the foliage grows exceptionally thick, and some of the plants there are known to be quite 
dangerous to walk near. The supposed reason is that there is a series of tunnels beneath the 
gardens, and a powerful relic is hidden under that spot. No-one has ever been able to find 
the entrance to this alleged dungeon however, and no-one knows if it is a relic that is 
causing this verdant growth, or some other cause.  
85 
You notice guards stationed on the battlements around the city walls. Asking a passing 
citizen why they are so vigilant, the citizen replies, “There were rumours that a nearby 
giant colony was planning an attack… so, naturally, that’s got everyone worried.” 
86 
You pass a building which bears a plaque: “Alyssa Ibold, Scholar of the Realms. Detailed 
knowledge on all countries and settlements within the known world. Consultations 10 sp 
per hour.” 
87 
If one of your PCs worships a god, they see a festival in progress honouring their god. This 
might be weird if their god is a rare one, but in that case, this is a rare sighting of public 
practice of that religion. If it is a major religion, then this is a festival holiday. If this 
doesn’t fit with your character, reroll.  
88 
Many guards are stationed on street corners, preventing access to several city blocks. 
“Don’t go in there,” one of them tells you. “Trust me, you don’t want to go in there.” 
89 
You pass a high wall, overrun with creepers. Reaching the gate of this large compound, you 
peer in to see a huge, dilapidated building, probably once glorious. A sign on the gate reads 
Compassionate Asylum for Victims of Mind Magic. 
90 
There is a loud crack, and lightning strikes the ground mere feet away from you, filling the 
air with a strange, burnt smell. Looking up, you see that it is a clear sky, not a cloud. So 
where did that come from? Does someone powerful have designs on you? 
91 
Two friendly old wizards are using mage hand to put on a puppet show for local children. 
The story, however, seems almost too fantastical to be true, and you find yourself drawn in. 
Does this outlandish tale come from the wizards’ own experience? 
92 
A gnarled old streetside merchant, who looks like he’s seen some things in his time, is 
selling pieces of monster anatomy and items made from said anatomy.  
93 
Some young apprentice mages are being bullied by some young warriors-in-training. A 
classic jocks vs nerds scenario. As you watch, you see that one of the young mages is 
quietly forming a spell between his hands… You have to see how this turns out!

94 
A cartload of prisoners rumbles past. You see all sorts of faces in there, male and female, 
human, orc, elf, halfling, but all having the look of professional soldiers. 
“Heading to the prisoner of war camp, three miles out of town,” a passer-by remarks, 
noticing your interest. “Enemy soldiers transported back here after the latest conflict. A 
rebellion which the Empire just stamped out. Why they don’t just put them out of their 
misery is beyond me.” 
95 
Camped out on the steps of city hall, a tribe of nomadic warriors has erected tents, 
including a chief’s tent, has made campfires and are roasting a large dead animal on a spit. 
The town guard are standing around, hesitant to ask these rugged-looking barbarians to 
move on. Why have they travelled here, you wonder, so far from their homelands? Do they 
have some issue with the ruling power?

Chapter 3-3 
Dungeon Encounters 
 
This chapter contains an all-new list of random non-combat dungeon encounters for you to use in 
your solo adventures. Many of these can function as adventure seeds also. 
 
When to use these?  
• 
As an alternative to the tables in TSAT 1  
• 
When an oracle triggers it (such as when you roll doubles in Mythic).  
• 
When your adventure has stalled and you need something to get it going again. 
• 
When you’re in a dungeon and a system tells you to roll a random encounter  
 
Never let the rules of a solo system stand in the way of creating engaging action. If nothing is 
happening, make something happen (unless your characters want downtime).   
If you do not like the result you have rolled, simply roll again. These are adventuring aids, not rules. 
 
d100 RESULT 
1 
You find a stricken individual, slumped against the wall of the room/passage and raving to 
themselves incoherently. They have obviously been involved in something highly 
traumatic which has robbed them of their wits.  
2 
This area of the dungeon has fallen into disrepair. The passage ahead looks dangerous, like 
it could cave in at any moment. You will need to proceed with extreme caution. 
3 
An almighty roar fills the passages, echoing around you. It seems to be coming from [d4] 
(1-2) Nearby (3-4) Far away.  
4 
A drunk dwarf is staggering down the passage towards you, arm in arm with a similarly 
drunk halfling. They are regaling each other with outlandish stories of their adventures, 
and do not initially notice you.  
5 
You find an adventurer’s corpse (roll on NPC tables to discover details). They have an 
interesting [d6] (1-2) Note (3-4) Bounty (5-6) Map on their person. 
6 
You find a humanoid child, hiding behind a pillar. They do not speak your language and 
you have no idea what they are doing here. 
7 
Within a room, a floating orb sits atop a plinth. You approach… the orb is translucent, and 
many colours swirl within it… what do you see? 
8 
You see what looks like a portal ahead. The air is stale here, however, and the walls drip 
with some foul contagion... 
9 
A magical darkness permeates this area, originating from a point you cannot see. Suddenly, 
a priest comes into view, smiling and holding forth a holy symbol. “Ah!” he cries. “You’ve 
come, at last!” 
10 
You discover a sinkhole in the floor of the passage. Peering down, you see several levels of 
dungeon passages below you, but the sinkhole (natural?) descends out of sight. 
11 
There is a celebration going on somewhere nearby… the sound of goblets being clinked, 
wine being poured, even a band of minstrels… but there is a smell hanging heavy in the 
air… the smell of rotting flesh. Of death… or undeath?

12 
A notice is tacked onto a wall. “The fight for the prize begins soon. The victor will claim 
the symbol of our deity! You will be witness to a great contest…” 
13 
You come across a creature, which has been wounded. Roll a d8 to find out what type of 
wounded creature you have come across: (1) aberration (2) beast (3) elemental (4) fiend   
(5) humanoid (6) monstrosity (7) undead (8) dragon. It is not combative. Perhaps an 
intelligent creature capable of communication might negotiate with you if you can help to 
heal it. However, do so with care! 
14 
Huge fungi grow in this area, standing as tall as an ogre! Moving through, you must be 
careful not to bump them or they will release spores. Make a DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) 
check. If you fail, roll three times on the Keywords table (p.167) to discover the nature of 
the effect the spores have on you.  
15 
A sprite, or some sort of small creature, is down the end of a passageway, beckoning to you. 
“This way! Yes, come, follow!” 
16 
You feel imbued with a heroic spirit. The god of courage has smiled on you, granting you a 
boon. Roll on the Boon table (p.152). 
17 
You happen upon an underground settlement of some kind. If this is in an established 
dungeon, perhaps it is a colony of tiny creatures, or an enclave of hermits. If in caverns, or 
the Underdark, it could be svirfneblin or duergar or drow perhaps. They are not initially 
aware of your presence and you have the opportunity of observing from afar until you 
decide to interact.  
18 
The ground begins to shudder, and dust falls from the roof. Perhaps even a chunk of 
masonry or two falls to the floor. Is this an earthquake, or some huge creature 
approaching? Either way, it’s seismic. 
19 
You meet a friendly NPC who immediately engages you in conversation. However, they 
are accompanied by a powerful stench which almost has you gagging. Make a DC 12 
Constitution saving throw. If you fail, you are violently ill.  
20 
An adventuring party is ahead, you think. You can hear conversation, several different 
voices, and they speak in a mixture of Common, Dwarvish and Elvish.  
21 
Small alcoves in either wall house icons to a range of deities you have never seen before. 
The workmanship looks ancient.  
22 
Within a room, atop a table, you find a fascinating object: an intricately crafted miniature 
version of a dungeon. This dungeon? Who crafted this and for what purpose? 
23 
Rows of sarcophagi line either side of this room. Their plaques bear fascinating, and very 
old inscriptions.  
24 
You stop in your tracks. Ahead (in a room or passage, generate next bit of the dungeon to 
find out what) you see a mage of some kind deep in the performance of a ritual. But you 
have no way of knowing their nature, or the nature of the ritual.  
25 
The sound of rushing water comes from nearby. An underground river? 
26-
30 
Roll a d4. (1-2) Roll on Skill Challenge table, p.139 (3-4) Level-appropriate easy encounter 
31 
A trio of gnome artificers are here, hard at work studying some phenomenon, device, 
construct or other thing. They are escorted by two hulking mercenary warriors. A 
scientific expedition, it would seem. Stealth roll, DC 14, to see if you are noticed, initially.

32 
A noxious, yellowish slime covers the walls and floor here. Moving through is going to 
require agility, and who knows what the effect could be if any of the stuff lands on you… 
(Use keywords to determine) 
33 
A small humanoid runs past and tosses an item into your hands. It is a [d6] (1) Ring (2) 
Rod (3) Scroll (4) Staff (5) Wand (6) Weapon. They are gone before you can respond, 
calling these words back over their shoulder. “Your problem now!”  
Is something pursuing them? Or have they just offloaded a potentially cursed item on you? 
34 
There is a lot of noise and hubbub coming from ahead. The clank of steel-shod boots, the 
shouting of commands. You appear to be approaching a barracks of some kind, and it 
sounds like they are mobilising for battle! 
35 
You find a room filled with cages. 1d6 of these cages have captives inside them. You find 
any combination of the following: [1d20] (1) Rich Noble (2) Charming thief (3) Talkative 
explorer (4) Whiny scientist (5) Gruff admiral (6) Innocent shapeshifter (7) Dishevelled 
navigator (8) Greedy priest (9) Apathetic immortal (10) Ignorant royal (11) Distracted 
artificer (12) Impatient engineer (13) Xenophobic artist (14) Sympathetic monk (15) 
Agitated cultist (16) Angry town guard (17) Affectionate merchant (18) Cursed aberration 
(19) Shrewd judge (20) Gloomy assassin.   
36 
Ahead, you see the passage seemingly dissolve into nothingness. A void opens up before 
you. Where a passage was before, now is a swirling, nondescript energy… a portal of some 
kind? You are hesitant to continue, but also intrigued… Should you back away and try 
another path, or throw yourself into this strange energy and see where it leads you? 
37 
At the side of the passage, a beautiful little font, ornately crafted with figures of benevolent, 
childlike gods, receives silvery water into its stone basin. It radiates a soft, healing energy. 
Drinking from this font will restore 4d4+8 hp to your character, but you can gain this 
benefit only once.  
38 
A magical darkness descends. And in this darkness, a voice starts whispering to you, about 
something from your past that no-one could possibly know about. When the darkness 
finally lifts, no-one is there… Is someone playing mind games with you, or are you going 
insane? 
39 
If you have an NPC with you, they begin acting strangely… as if this place is getting to 
them, affecting them in some way.  
40 
An offensive smell reaches your nostrils… You come across a pit where all sorts of refuse 
have been dumped. There must be a humanoid settlement nearby that has seen fit to fill 
this area with their trash, with no consideration for the other inhabitants of this dungeon. 
Or, perhaps this is ancient refuse, left here by a group of creatures who have since departed. 
Either way, it smells utterly repulsive, and you suspect some foul rot-dweller may be 
lurking in there... 
41 
You find a collection of items in a bag which you are trying hard to make sense of. Roll five 
times on the Items table (p.163). Who did this belong to? 
42 
Rounding a corner, you see a door hanging off its hinges, and a procession of creatures 
running in and out of a room carrying various looted items. A stash of some kind has been 
discovered, and it is a free-for-all. The stash consists of one of the following items [d10]  
(1-2) Food (3-4) Alcohol (5-6) Weapons (7-8) Wood for burning (9-10) Random 
assortment of all of the above. 
43 
A fresh smell comes to you, as if there was an opening to the outside somewhere near, a 
vent of fresh air. Then, you round a corner, and see a tree, somehow magically growing in

the middle of a widened section of passage. It is suffused with magical light, as if suspended 
in a bubble, and sits in the middle of a richly-carved dark stone circle which contains the 
soil it grows in.  
44 
Whoever your quarry is that you are stalking, the reason you entered this dungeon, you 
find a valuable clue relating to them. You receive this information in one of the following 
forms [d6] (1) Graffiti (2) Carved inscription (3) Note (4) Disembodied Voice (5) NPC (6) 
Overheard conversation.  
45 
A small pebble hits you on the back of the head. Turning around, you cannot see who 
threw it. 
46 
Entering a natural cavern, you happen upon a pile of gore and dead bodies. This looks like 
the food stash of some creature, but the smell coming off it is horrific. What lurks nearby? 
47 
Strange runes glow with an arcane energy, painted on the floor in this area. Make a DC 18 
Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Wisdom) check. If successful, you have seen these 
runes somewhere before and know something of their meaning. 
48 
A statue in the middle of this area looms high over you. Then, it opens its mouth and 
speaks to you! Roll on a keywords table or whatever tool you deem appropriate to 
determine its message. 
49 
An abyss runs across the passageway, dropping down out of sight. Looking down, you see 
the entrances to various other tunnels, as if peering down through the middle of a colony of 
insects. The only way across this expanse is a series of floating discs…  
50 
Entering a chamber, you see a machine or contraption of some sort at its centre, whirring 
and clicking away. What is this device and what is its purpose? 
51-
55 
Roll a d4. (1-2) Roll on Boon table, p.152 (3-4) level-appropriate medium encounter 
56 
Blood is pooled through this area, along with arrows, broken weapons, broken crates and 
other detritus. A pitched battle has gone on here, but you see no bodies… very strange.  
57 
A lone humanoid is wandering the corridors, muttering to themself about how they have 
been exiled, and how they will get revenge on those that cast them out.  
58 
Water drips from the ceiling above, forming pools here and there. Where is this water 
coming from… and is it indeed water at all? 
59 
You hear the sound of a waterfall from somewhere nearby, and also a mechanical noise of 
some kind, a machine-like sound… Then, above that, the chatter of voices, although due to 
the sound of the water you can’t make out what language they are speaking. What is going 
on up ahead? 
60 
This area contains ancient frescoes, some of them ruined, but some remarkably well-
preserved. They reveal important lore about the quest you are on, specifically in relation to 
important people related to that quest, and their history.  
61 
You find a mirror, a small hand-held mirror on the floor. Picking it up, you see that it 
appears some creature (monster? NPC?) is trapped inside it. How did they come to be here, 
and why was this artifact simply left lying on the floor? 
62 
A lever is in the left wall. There is no indication of what it controls, or that it controls 
anything at all. Perhaps it is defunct. But there is only one way to find out…

[d6] Pulling the lever (1) Opens a trapdoor (2) Releases acid rain into the corridor (3) 
Opens a dimensional portal (4) Opens a previously locked door in a nearby part of the 
dungeon (5) Triggers a spear trap (6) Opens a secret door nearby. 
63 
You suddenly emerge on a mezzanine-type floor overlooking a large chamber below. 
Something is going on down there. Creatures are congregating, but they haven’t seen you 
yet.  
[d6] (1) Gladiatorial battle (2) Summoning ritual (3) Court trial (4) Meeting of cultists or 
other group around a large table (5) Battle between monster factions (6) Leader addressing 
a large group.  
64 
The relentless rhythmic thud of large drums is vibrating from somewhere distant. Is it 
coming from underneath you? You can feel the pounding through the floor.  
65 
A broken construct lies wrecked in this area. It has been partially, but not wholly, looted 
for parts. [d6] (1) Retriever (2) Iron Golem (3) d4 Iron Cobras (4) Oaken Bolter (5) 
Animated Armour (6) Hellfire Engine. 
66 
You enter a chamber which appears to be a wizard’s or artificer’s laboratory. Plenty of 
interesting artifacts, and quite a few blueprints and other things as well. Roll a d100. If 
under 20, you find a common magic item. If under 10, you find an uncommon magic item.   
67 
Several boiling cauldrons are in this area, giving off bizarre fumes.  
68 
You emerge in a chamber which is split into two levels, lower and higher. Two groups of 
humanoids are battling each other, one on the lower ground and one on the higher ground. 
Neither have noticed you as yet. 
69 
A strange field of coloured light is ahead, dancing hypnotically. Make a DC 14 Wisdom 
save or you are entranced by this. Who set up this magical trap, and why? 
70 
You come across several humanoid (or possibly giant) creatures, rolling around on the 
floor laughing. Something has amused them, but what? Perhaps this is some magic, and 
you are in danger of falling under it also… 
71 
A series of huge pillars line both sides of this corridor, which is good as you can hear a 
creature of quite some size approaching! Might be time to hide… 
72 
Make a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. If unsuccessful, you fail to notice a skulk deftly 
relieving you of wealth. Choose either a random item or 2d100 gp to remove from your 
inventory. If successful, you catch him in the act, and he immediately flees. Make one 
opportunity attack and then pursue if you wish, encountering 1 skulk. 
73 
There are shallow channels in the floor here, in an interesting, symmetrical pattern. You 
can find no clue as to their purpose, but a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check might 
reveal something. If successful, roll on Keywords table (p.167).  
74 
A room containing chests full of mundane items. Roll ad20 times on the Items table (p.163), 
discarding inappropriate results like rubble, broken wood etc. All results should be things 
that have reasonably belonged to someone at some stage. 
75 
The smell of food cooking comes to you, making your mouth water.  
76-
80 
Roll a d4. (1-2) Roll on Bane table, p.157 (3-4) level-appropriate hard encounter 
81 
A group of creatures is ahead, working on renovating a section of the tunnel. What are 
they doing, and what are their motivations? [d6] (1) Clearing an obstruction (2)

Constructing a trap (3) Tunnelling a new passage into the rock (4) Decorating this area of 
the tunnel with a mural or runes (5) Mining for minerals (6) Forcing slaves to do their 
work (roll again to determine what that work is).  
82 
You hear the sound of musical instruments, many playing together, but discordant, and 
well out-of-tune with each other. 
83 
Within a pool, a flawless gem shimmers.  
84 
A burning energy begins to take hold of everything… flammable objects nearby burst into 
flame, metal objects like torch sconces and doorknobs begin to glow red hot, and 
everything is suffused with heat. What creature or curse is causing this? 
85 
Concealed from prying eyes, you stumble somehow across a small library of rare tomes. 
What strange volumes do you find in here? 
86 
Conscription patrol. A band of humanoids is approaching. They are searching for recruits 
for their army in an upcoming battle against an enemy force. Are you allied with their 
cause?  
87 
A haunting moan, as of many tormented voices together, begins to come to you, quietly, on 
the air. It is impossible to determine the source of this disturbing noise.  
88 
A bridge extends over (1) Natural geysers (2) Acid pools (3) Lava (4) Dimensional rift. 
89 
In the middle of a room, a pendulum swings from side to side, accompanied by a loud 
ticking noise. Runes are inscribed around all the walls; every surface is covered with 
writing in... [d6]  
(1) Dwarvish (2) Abyssal (3) Infernal (4) Undercommon (5-6) Whatever is most relevant to 
your adventure. What is the purpose of this device? 
90 
An idol on a pedestal speaks to you as you pass. “You have forgotten something of your 
past, traveller. I know all secrets… do you wish me to tell it to you?” If your PC has 
wishes, this Idol of Memory will reveal a hidden fact about their past. 
91 
As you progress through this area, a succession of ghostly apparitions appear on either side 
of you, telling you to turn back, that you are entering an area of ancient evil.  
92 
A huge, beautifully-crafted fountain depicts a magical beast and a greenish water spouts 
from its mouth, filling the pool below the fountain. 50% chance this area is inhabited by 
humanoids. 
93 
A portal, swirling with planar energy, stands in this area. On the steps leading up to it, you 
see a note held in place by a stone. It reads. “I waited, but you did not come. Now I go to do 
the deed. Come find me if you have the courage.” 
94 
A huge cage, like a birdcage, is suspended from the roof in this area. However, several of 
the bars are bent open as if what was in it has escaped.  
95 
Ahead, a group of humanoids is towing a large cart carrying [d6] (1) Junk (2) Minerals (3) 
Prisoners (4) Military supplies (5) Food supplies (6) A captive and angry monster.

Chapter 3-4 
100 Skill Challenges 
 
When to use these? You can use these at any time, when an oracle determines you have encountered 
an obstacle, or when some other game effect triggers a skill challenge. They are included as a rollable 
result on the random encounter tables. They are also included as a rollable result in the battlemap 
crawl system (Chapter 1-5), and in the 6d12 table (Chapter 1-4).  
Depending on the check and the context of your quest, you might have all of your characters 
attempting, or just one. You should judge what is appropriate in the moment. You may decide to 
allow other characters may help if they have some knowledge with the relevant skill. Use your 
discretion.  
I have tried to write these to be appropriate for any environment. But here and there a tweak to the 
flavour/narrative may be required to make these fit in the context of your quest. Feel free to do so. 
Tiers & scaling: You will notice that every skill check includes a direction to add your tier. This is 
so that difficulty scales upwards as you advance in levels. Check p.13 for an explanation of tiers 
within 5e.  
Several of these skill challenges were suggested by members of the Dungeons & Dragons Solo 
Adventures Facebook page. A huge thanks to those members for their contribution. 
 
d100 RESULT 
1 
Crack in the ground. You encounter a wide gap, with an abyss below, and no way over 
except jumping. Make a DC 13 + tier Strength (Athletics) check to get across, or find some 
other method. (Fly spells, or use of a rope, tree log etc).  
2 
You slip on a section of slippery ground. Make a DC 11 + tier Dexterity (Acrobatics) check 
or take 1d4-1 bludgeoning damage. 
3 
You come across a humanoid who has been wounded in battle. Make a DC 15 + tier 
Wisdom (Medicine) check to get them up and moving. If successful, you may gain 1 
sidekick who has a maximum of (tier) hd. For more information on tiers, see p.13.   
4 
Dungeon: You are passing through a huge colony of bats, which are all currently sleeping. 
Make a DC 13 + tier Dexterity (Stealth) check. If you fail, they all awaken and flap around 
you. Make a DC 18 + tier Dexterity saving throw. If you fail, take 2d6 piercing damage, 
half on a successful save. 
Wilderness: A herd of animals is crossing your path. Make a DC 13 + tier Wisdom 
(Animal Handling) check to successfully navigate your way through. If you fail, the 
panicked animals start a stampede, and you must make a DC 20 + tier Dexterity saving 
throw. If you fail, take 2d6 bludgeoning damage, half on a successful save. 
5 
Something is tracking you! Make a DC 14 + tier Wisdom (Nature) check, a DC 17 + tier 
Dexterity (Stealth) check or a DC 17 + tier Intelligence (Investigation) check. If you fail, 
you are surprised during the first round of your next combat encounter, and you cannot 
gain surprise at the start of this encounter either.   
6 
The path here is blocked by some fallen obstacle. Make a DC 15 + tier Strength (Athletics) 
check to clear the obstacle, or choose a different path.  
7 
There is some sort of wild magic field here. Make a DC 15 + tier Intelligence (Arcana) 
check to determine the nature of it, otherwise any spells you cast in this area are subject to 
rolls on the wild magic table (PHB, p.104).

8 
You come across a historical account of the happenings here, either a mural or markings 
etched on rock. Make a DC 14 + tier Intelligence (History) check. If successful, you have 
advantage on all Intelligence- and Wisdom-based checks for the remainder of this quest.   
9 
Some kind of slaughter or battle has gone on in this area. Make a DC 14 + tier Intelligence 
(Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check to discern the nature of past events. If 
successful, gain an inspiration.  
10 
You find a shrine to a deity, although the statue is partially disfigured and it is hard to 
identify. Make a DC 14 + tier Intelligence (Religion) check. If successful, roll once on the 
Boon table (p.152).  
11 
A short pillar bears an interesting relic, but it appears that it is resting on a pressure plate. 
Nearby is a stone or similar object that looks like it could be roughly the same weight. 
Make a DC 17 + tier Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to replace the item. If successful, 
gain one common magic item.  
12 
A group of potentially hostile humanoids are resting in this area. They appear quite drunk 
and demand you regale them with song! Make a DC 11 + tier Charisma (Performance) 
check. If successful, they throw a bit of gold at you! Gain 1d20 gp. If unsuccessful, 
encounter 1d4+1 thugs (or other low-level humanoid of your choice, minimum CR ¼). Due 
to their drunkenness, their attack rolls are all -2.  
13 
A spectral figure appears before you. “You shall not pass this point, traveler! I invoke the 
power of an ancient curse and forbid your passage! Only the mightiest may pass beyond 
me.” 
Make a DC 14 + tier Charisma (Intimidation) check, or a DC 19 + tier Charisma 
(Persuasion) check. If successful, you may proceed, and you gain an inspiration. If you fail, 
you must find another way around, or encounter 1 undead creature of hard difficulty.   
14 
Markings on a wall or a nearby rock read: “No-one bearing weapons may enter here.” If 
anyone in your party is carrying weapons, perhaps you can try to hide them from whatever 
force is at work here. Make a DC 14 + tier Charisma (Deception) check. If successful, you 
may proceed with your weapons. Otherwise, you may find another way around. If you 
choose to ignore this warning, make a DC 17 + tier Wisdom save, otherwise you are 
afflicted by an ancient curse which causes 3d8 psychic damage! 
15 
You find strange tracks on the floor/ground, which leads you to think there may be 
enemies nearby. Make a DC 11 + tier Wisdom (Survival) check. If successful, your enemies 
are surprised during the first round of your next combat encounter. 
16 
You find evidence of the evil handiwork of your enemy (roll keywords to discern the nature 
of it). This reveals something about your enemy’s persona. Make a DC 14 + tier Wisdom 
(Insight) check. If successful, you gain the following boon.  
Enemy Insight: During the next BBEG encounter, when an attack from that BBEG would 
hit, you can choose to have it miss instead. You can only use this boon once. 
17 
You come across a large patch of fungi growing here. There are all kinds of colours and 
shapes here, and some of them seem almost to glow with a kind of volatile fluorescence. 
Make a DC 12 + tier Wisdom (Survival), or Intelligence (Nature) check. If successful, you 
are able to gather the equivalent of two vials of basic poison (PHB, p.153). 
18 
You find some ancient architecture which appears strange. But it reminds you of something 
you have seen before. Make a DC 11 + tier Intelligence (History) check. If successful, you 
have advantage on saving throws to avoid the next trap you encounter.

19 
You feel a hint of a magical aura coming from somewhere nearby. If you have any affiliation 
with magic (i.e., you are a caster or a being for whom magic has played a part in their life) 
make a DC 17 + tier Intelligence (Arcana) check. If you succeed, you have advantage on 
saving throws against spells for the rest of this quest.   
20 
Dungeon: A nearby door is locked, with no latch or apparent way to open it (if there is no 
door in your current area, you suddenly notice one). However, it appears that the lever to 
open it is high up on the wall, near the ceiling. By using the walls as springboards, a 
dexterous character might be able to propel themselves up to the lever to activate it. Make 
a DC 15 + tier Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If successful, you make it to the lever and get 
the door open. Roll on Chamber Contents (DMG p.296 or TSAT2 p.36) to see what is 
behind this secret door. 
Wilderness: Storm Winds. A gust of powerful wind catches you by surprise, sending 
nearby objects into the air like missiles. Make a DC 12 +1d4 Dexterity saving throw to 
avoid the debris. On a failure you take 3d8 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. To 
continue you must succeed on a DC 12 + 1d4 Strength (Athletics) check or take shelter and 
wait out the storm winds. 
21 
You find a series of small niches in the wall where caskets could have been stowed. Some of 
them are broken open. Make a DC 17 + tier Intelligence (Religion) check. If successful, you 
sense the presence of undead creatures in the area, and your next combat encounter will 
feature undead creatures.  
If unsuccessful, the next combat encounter will feature undead, but your party will be 
surprised in the first round of combat. 
22 
Suddenly, from nowhere, a glowing, spectral blue rope appears, and begins wrapping 
around your hands and feet. Make a DC 14 + tier Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to 
attempt to get your hands free, and then your feet. If unsuccessful you are restrained for the 
next turn. You can use an action every turn to repeat this check, ending the effect as soon 
as you succeed on the check. 
23 
You encounter some low-level minions in the service of the BBEG. “Hello there,” they say, 
looking you up and down. “What brings you to our master’s domain, then?” 
There’s a chance you could get out of this situation. Make a DC 11 + tier Charisma 
(Deception) check. If successful, you may go on your way. If unsuccessful, roll a level-
appropriate easy encounter featuring humanoids. 
24 
You find markings possibly left by henchmen of the enemy you pursue. They speak of their 
leader’s power, stating that “All who come near our master shall be destroyed!” But 
something seems a little off about these boasts. Make a DC 14 + tier Wisdom (Insight) 
check to discern the deeper meanings behind these. If successful, you have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed or frightened during your next BBEG encounter.  
25 
An animal, trapped in a cage, is immediately friendly towards you. You may be able take it 
on as a companion, if your class allows it. What is required is a DC 12 + tier Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) or Thieves’ Tools check to unlock the cage and then a DC 13 Wisdom + 
tier (Animal Handling) check. If successful, you gain a beast companion up to the allowance 
for your class. For example, rangers have a limit on the CR of the beast they can choose to 
be their companion, which increases with their ranger level.  
26 
A far-off sound catches your attention. Make a DC 15 + tier Wisdom (Perception) check. If 
successful, you gain an insight into enemy movements. Take one inspiration or one Clue 
Point if playing the battlemap crawl/realm crawl method.  
27 
A pool is before you, shimmering like silver, and within you fancy you can see images, 
moving, beyond your reflection.

Make a DC 15 + tier Wisdom (Perception) check. If successful, you gain an insight into 
what is happening in another nearby area. During this quest, you have advantage on 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks to sneak up on enemies and surprise them. 
28 
You notice a swarm of tiny, gnat-like creatures swarming in one area. Make a DC 14 + tier 
Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. If successful, and you have an empty glass vial or other 
breakable vessel, you are able to capture some of these creatures. As a bonus action, you can 
throw these at a creature so that the vessel shatters on impact (or, alternately, you can open 
a vessel beside the creature and then disengage and move away as an action). The gnats will 
buzz around the nearest creature, imposing disadvantage on its attacks for 1d4 rounds.  
29 
A nearby architectural wall has strange contours, leading you to think there might be a 
hidden door here. Make a DC 16 + tier Intelligence (Investigation) check. If successful, you 
discover a hidden room. Roll for a new room using dungeon generation tools (or any tools 
you want). If the rolls produce a monster encounter, you can ignore this if you wish to (as 
the room was hidden for a long time).  
30 
If an NPC or sidekick is present, all of a sudden, they take offence at something you’ve 
done, either recently or sometime in the past. They are threatening to leave the party. Or, 
perhaps, if there are two members in this party, one disagrees with the other.  
Make a DC 15 + tier Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) check. If 
unsuccessful, the NPC or sidekick leaves the party. If the disagreement involves two 
characters, then for the remainder of this quest neither character can take advantage of 
traits that rely on having an ally present. Take note whether you used Persuasion or 
Intimidation, as this will colour future interactions. 
If you feel this check is unfair and will affect balance adversely, feel free to reroll.  
31 
You find the satchel of an apothecary. Perhaps you have no idea what many of these items 
do, but you might be willing to experiment. Make a DC 14 + tier Wisdom (Medicine) 
check. If successful, you gain 1 Healer’s Kit.  
32 
Nearby, you see a high rock ledge which seems to have an object placed on it. You can only 
see part of the object, and can’t really tell what it is, but it looks to be man-made. Perhaps 
someone placed it up there for safe-keeping. Reaching it is going to take some brute 
strength or agility.  
Make a DC 17 + tier Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check to reach this 
item. If successful, roll on the Items table (p.163). Reroll until you find something that 
makes sense given the context. If using the battlemap crawl method, gain 1 Clue Point. 
33 
You see large, looming statues ahead, that stand like sentinels, on either side of a narrow 
throughway. Their eyes glow red, and you sense a trap of some sort. Perhaps they simply 
act as alarms, letting nearby enemies know of the presence of trespassers. Make a DC 14 + 
tier Dexterity (Stealth) check to creep by these silent sentinels, or find another way around. 
If you fail the check, roll a d4. (1-2) The statues emit lightning from their eyes. Make a DC 
17 + tier Dexterity saving throw or take (tier) d6 lightning damage. (3-4) The statues 
begin to howl in an otherworldly dirge. You cannot gain surprise on enemies. Immediately 
initiate a medium-difficulty encounter. 
34 
You find evidence of a nearby small mining operation. Make a DC 14 + tier Intelligence 
(History) check. If successful, you know who was mining here, and what they were mining 
for. Make a DC 19 + tier Intelligence (Investigation) check. If successful, gain 1d4 x 100 gp 
gems.  
35 
You find a small natural rock alcove where slime covers every surface. Even coming near it 
causes you to gag and your breath to catch in your throat. It is clearly poisonous.  
Make a DC 11 + tier Intelligence (Nature) check. If successful, you have advantage on 
saving throws against poison while in this dungeon / wilderness area. Additionally, if you

have something to gather it in, you can attempt a DC 18 + tier Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check. Also gain 2 vials of basic poison (PHB p.153). 
If unsuccessful, make a DC 13 + tier Constitution save or take 3d6 poison damage. 
36 
You find evidence of cult-like, ritualistic activity. At some point in the recent past, it 
appears a cult has worshipped here.  
Make a DC 14 + tier Intelligence (Religion) check. If successful, gain your choice of an 
inspiration or 1 Clue Point. 
37 
Someone has erected a barrier here, to try and hamper the progress of anyone approaching. 
Make a DC 15 + tier Wisdom (Insight) check to try and discern who built this, and what 
their intentions might have been. If successful, roll a d4. (1-2) A possible ally erected this, 
who is still somewhere nearby. Make a DC 14 + tier Intelligence (Investigation) check. If 
successful, gain 1 sidekick. (3-4) An enemy erected this. Gain either an inspiration or 1 Clue 
Point.  
38 
You find a dead creature which died in a bizarre way, as a result of some magically inflicted 
disease, or possibly by poison. Make a DC 14 + tier Wisdom (Medicine) check. If successful, 
you are able to gain knowledge of how this creature died.  
For the rest of this quest, you have advantage on saving throws against one of the 
following (choose, based on what is most appropriate for your current quest and the 
monsters you have encountered): poison, acid or necrotic damage.    
If none of these are appropriate, gain an inspiration or a Clue Point instead.  
39 
You are aware that at some stage you are going to need to rest, and as you move through 
this area you begin scouting for potential campsites. Make a DC 11 + tier Wisdom 
(Survival) check. If successful, you find a campsite and will not be disturbed during your 
next rest. If unsuccessful, there is a 50% chance that you rest will be disturbed by a creature 
during your next rest. The next time you choose to rest, roll a d100. If 50 or under, roll for 
a monster encounter. Unless someone was on watch, the monster has advantage on 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks to surprise you. 
40 
You find a piece of graffiti on a wall. It reads “A message for my fellow travelers: The 
creatures in these parts love a song and dance. It saved my life when I was wandering 
through these parts. May it save yours too.” 
Save this for your next combat encounter. When you next encounter monsters, make a DC 
13 + tier Charisma (Performance) check. If successful, the creatures do not attack, and you 
may leave the area without further mishap. However, this effect will end if you cause 
damage to any of these creatures.  
41 
You encounter a fountain. An ancient plaque proclaims it to be a place of arcane restoration, 
for those who can discern its secrets.  
Any caster or character who possesses some sort of innate spellcasting ability, can make a 
DC 13 + tier Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, regain spell slots equivalent to your 
level divided by half. For example, if you are level 10, you gain 5 levels of spell slots. This 
could be a level 2 spells slot and a level 3 spell slot, or a level 2 slot and three level 1 slots, 
or any combination. If you are level 1, regain a level 1 spell slot. This boon cannot be used 
to gain extra spell slots. If all your spell slots are unused, restore your hp to max instead. 
42 
A strange series of runes painted on the floor (or a rock, if outdoors) are glowing, and 
represent symbols that have an evil look to them. Make a DC 14 + tier Intelligence 
(Religion) check. If successful, you sense the presence of fiends in the area. Fiends have been 
summoned to this area, and are possibly roaming nearby.  
Your next combat encounter will feature fiends. If your Religion check was unsuccessful, 
make a DC 13 + tier Wisdom (Perception) check at the start of the fiend encounter. If 
unsuccessful, you are surprised in the first round of combat.

43 
You suddenly get the feeling you are being watched, as if your enemy has eyes everywhere, 
magical or otherwise. Make a DC 14 + tier Dexterity (Stealth) check. If successful, gain 
either an inspiration or 1 Clue Point. 
44 
You suddenly remember hearing something in the last settlement about this place, a detail 
that has only just come back to you. Make a DC 11 + tier Intelligence (History) check. If 
successful, your character immediately learns the location of the BBEG, and their monster 
type. They have advantage on Stealth rolls to determine surprise at the start of the BBEG 
encounter. 
45 
After spending some time in this area, you are starting to get a feel for the lay of the place 
and your senses are heightened. Make a DC 11 + tier Wisdom (Survival) check. If 
successful, enemies have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to creep up on you. 
46 
You suspect you might have picked up a tail. It feels as if you are being followed. Nothing 
you can pin down, just a feeling of being watched.  
Make a DC 13 + tier Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check. If successful, you 
sense the location of the tail and are able to lose them. If unsuccessful, encounter 1 monster 
of the type that fits with the theme of your current quest. 
47 
All of a sudden, the floor is flooded with a slippery substance that you think is oil. Make a 
DC 13 + tier Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity saving throw to stay on your feet or 
become prone and take 1d4 bludgeoning from the fall. Perhaps this is the beginning of an 
ambush? If in wilderness, some other disorienting force has come into play, such as a 
log/pit trap or even the area being flooded with tar or something crazy like that.  
48 
The plant life in here is familiar to you, you think. Make a DC 11 + tier Wisdom (Nature) 
check. If successful, you find 1d6 healing berries. Each heals 3 hp and may be consumed as a 
bonus action.  
49 
“Traveler!” a disembodied voice suddenly addresses you. “The ancient goddess of mischief 
demands you entertain her with a song. Sing, little one! I have been bored for so long in this 
place. Entertain me!”  
Make a DC 14 + tier Charisma (Performance) check. If successful, you gain the Charm of 
Heroism (10 temporary hit points) for the remainder of your current quest. If you fail, make 
a roll on the [d4] (1-3) Bane table, p.157 (4) Boon table, p.152. 
50 
A tormented spirit appears to you, accusing you of trespassing here. “All who come here 
want only one thing: to raid the treasures within this sanctum. You shall not do the same!” 
Make a DC 14 + tier Charisma (Persuasion) check. If unsuccessful, the spirit will let you go 
on your way. If you fail, encounter one hard spectral undead creature (such as a ghost or a 
specter).  
51 
You come across a secret door which has jammed on opening. There is enough of a gap that 
you can see through, but not enough that you can fit. Make a DC 15 + tier Strength 
(Athletics) check to get it open wide enough, and then you can move through to the other 
side. Make a 6d12 table roll in either the Special Room Column or the Passage column, 
adding 2 to every d12.  
52 
There is an area here that is blocked by a huge portcullis, secured by a sturdy lock. If in 
wilderness, treat this as a tomb or some kind of gatehouse. If proficient with thieves’ tools, 
you may attempt a DC 15 + tier Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or thieves’ tools check to get 
the door open. Otherwise, a DC 19 + tier Strength (Athletics) check will allow you to bash 
this portcullis in, but the noise might attract enemies! 
53 
From some way ahead you hear voices! Make a DC 15 + tier Wisdom (Perception) or 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern who is speaking, and whether they are friendly

or hostile (use oracle rolls). If hostile, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check (using their passive 
Perception as the DC) to sneak up on them. 
54 
An inquisitive beast is lurking nearby, and seems agitated, almost as if it is trying to tell 
you something, or warn you of something. Its behaviour seems odd.  
Make a DC 15 + tier Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. If successful gain one of the 
following boons of your choice: (1) Gain a clue point (2) Gain an inspiration (3) You cannot 
be surprised for the remainder of the quest (4) When the next combat encounter is 
triggered, treat it that your character already knew the location. Give them advantage on a 
Dexterity (Stealth) check vs the enemy’s passive Perception. If successful, the enemy is 
surprised in the first round of combat. 
55 
You discover a piece of arcane war machinery, but it is poised on the brink of self-
destruction. The only thing stopping it from going off is a bladed weapon, which has been 
stuck in the mechanism to jam it. The weapon is ornate and appears enchanted. The weapon 
type is one of the following [d4] (1) Shortsword (2) Longsword (3) Rapier (4) Greatsword. 
To retrieve this rare-looking weapon, make a DC 17 + tier Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or 
thieves’ tools check to disable the war machine. If successful, gain a Vicious Weapon (DMG 
p.209). If unsuccessful, you inadvertently trigger the device, which explodes! Take (tier x 5) 
d6 bludgeoning damage from the explosion. 
56 
You see a door in a wall, with three bells positioned above the door. Each has a rope 
hanging from it. A plaque reads Play for me a tune to hear, and the way before you will be clear. 
Make a DC 13 + tier Charisma (Performance) check. If successful, you gain entry to this 
mysterious door. If unsuccessful, there is no extra effect.  
The door could open onto a previously undiscovered chamber, or one already present in 
your quest. Use standard generation tools to populate this chamber. If you are outdoors, 
treat it as a small shrine or wilderness tomb. 
57 
You are extremely on edge. Did you just hear something? A flicker of movement in the 
corner of your eye? Make a DC 13 + tier Wisdom (Survival) check. If successful, you have 
advantage on Dexterity saving throws to avoid traps while in this area. 
58 
From seemingly nowhere, a bolt of lightning streaks towards you! Make a DC 15 + tier 
Dexterity saving throw to avoid this arcane trap, taking 2d10 lightning damage on a failed 
save. Once you recover yourself, you see that up in a high spot is a relic of some sort which 
has been enchanted to fire lightning bolts at any who attempt to pass below (If outside, it is 
positioned up in a tree, if in a dungeon it is ensconced in the wall). However, vines lead up 
to where it is, making it possible to reach. Make a DC 14 + tier Dexterity (Acrobatics) 
check to get to the relic which is causing all this havoc, then remove it from its sconce, 
which will stop it functioning as a trap. Then, make a roll on one of the magic item tables to 
determine what the relic is (Chapter 4-6) [d10] (1-7) Common (8-9) Uncommon (10) Rare.   
59 
You think back to your last combat encounter, and it occurs to you that there was some 
design in how you and your allies were targeted. The creature which you seek has nefarious 
designs of some description on you, but you can’t discern exactly what those designs are. 
Make a DC 15 + tier Wisdom (Insight) check. If successful, gain your choice of one of the 
following (1) Inspiration for all party members (2) Roll once on the Boon table (p.152) and 
apply that to the character who rolled this result.  
60 
You come across a semi-conscious PC, on the brink of death. They seem eager to tell you 
something… Make a DC 15 + tier Wisdom (Medicine) check. If successful, you gain 
important knowledge regarding your quest. Use keywords and/or oracles to determine the 
nature of this knowledge. Also, if successful, gain your choice of one of the following (1) 
Inspiration for all party members (2) Roll once on the Boon table (p.152) and apply that to a

character of your choice. From here, it is up to here whether you let this character 
peacefully depart or whether you nurse him back to health and gain a sidekick/NPC. 
61 
Your sidekick or NPC, if they are with the group, refuses to continue. “Something’s not 
right about this… I won’t walk willingly to my own demise!” 
You try your best to convince them to continue. Make a DC 11 + tier Charisma 
(Persuasion) check. If unsuccessful, choose one of the following: (1) Lose a Clue Point 
(Battlemap Crawl System) (2) Lose your sidekick or NPC (3) While you waste time 
conversing, a wandering monster or monsters discovers your location and attacks! Roll for 
1 Medium encounter. 
62 
Pick (or roll for) a random member of your party. They start to feel queasy, possibly as a 
result of something they ingested lately. Eventually they can’t go on and have to sit down. 
Trying to help them with this digestive ailment is going to require a DC 11 + tier Wisdom 
(Medicine) check. Alternatively, have them make a DC 14 + tier Constitution saving throw. 
If you fail either roll, that character takes the Poisoned condition.  
63 
Your adventuring partner (if you have one, or an NPC) begins insisting on a course of 
action that you thoroughly disagree with (roll keywords for details). Make a Charisma 
(Persuasion) check equal or above their Wisdom score to talk them out of it. Alternately, 
(or if the Persuasion check does not work) make a Charisma (Deception) check equal or 
above their Wisdom score to make it look like you are going along with their suggested 
course of action, when in truth you have no intention of doing so. If you choose the 
Deception route, be aware that this will have consequences later on when they discover 
your true intentions!  
64 
A monster appears and forbids you from proceeding. Consult your monster lists and make 
this a Medium - Hard level encounter, appropriate to your current environment. Make a 
Charisma (Intimidation) check equal or above this monster’s Wisdom score to avoid the 
encounter and pass unheeded. Otherwise, either backtrack or encounter the monster!   
65 
From out of nowhere, objects begin raining from the sky! These could be small rocks, 
hailstones, or any other object (perhaps this is the result of some magical effect). Make it 
appropriate to your story.  
Make a DC 14 + tier Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, or take (tier x 2) d10 damage of a type 
appropriate to the objects (e.g., bludgeoning damage for rocks). 
66 
You pass a wall that is decorated with a mural, but the humanoid and animal figures in it 
seem to be moving. Make a DC 14 + tier Intelligence (History) or Intelligence (Arcana) 
check to learn more about the nature of this mural, what it depicts and how it came to be 
here. Generate story using keywords. 
67 
You find a musical instrument on the ground.  
Roll a d6 to find out what it is. (1-2) Flute (3-4) Lute (5-6) Hand drum.  
Make a DC 17 + tier Charisma (Performance) check to play this instrument. If successful, 
you activate its arcane nature. This instrument transforms into an animal familiar which 
will be loyal to you for the remainder of this quest, and will appear whenever you use a 
bonus action to play a note or two on the instrument. You can dismiss the creature and 
have it transform back into an instrument as an action. The creature is a [d6] (1) Wolf (2) 
Boar (3) Giant Badger (4) Black Bear (5) Brown Bear (6) Dire Wolf. What you have in fact 
found, is a familiar instrument (homebrew magic item).  
68 
A strange sound is coming from somewhere (roll on the table found on DMG p.298 for 
details). To discover its origin, make a DC 11 + tier Intelligence (Investigation) check. If 
successful, roll a d4. The sound is (1) Near (2) Far (3-4) Wherever you are.

69 
This area is littered with the corpses of a particular type of animal. But what killed them 
all? Make a DC 13 + tier Wisdom (Nature) check to discover what caused the death of 
these poor creatures. If successful, use keywords or Mythic event meaning tables to 
generate details.  
70 
A holy (or unholy) symbol is marked on the wall in blood. Make a DC 13 + tier Intelligence 
(Religion) check to see if you can determine what deity this symbol represents. If successful, 
decide what the deity is based on the current quest context, or devise a dice roll to come up 
with a random god. This god will now form one of the threads of your solo adventure. The 
next time you roll for monsters with any system, roll twice and choose the result. 
71 
You see a potential mount nearby, roaming wild, complete with saddle. Obviously, this 
creature has lost its former master. The mount is a (1) Mastiff (2) Donkey (3) Pony (4) 
Draft Horse (5) Riding Horse (6) Warhorse. Make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. 
The DC is 10 + the result of the d6 roll. If successful, you gain this mount.  
72 
A random member of your adventuring party slips on some loose rubble and rolls their 
ankle! Make a DC 11 + tier Wisdom (Medicine) check to treat this sprain or the character’s 
move speed is reduced by half until they complete a long rest. 
73 
One character in the party seems very preoccupied, distracted by some thought. They are 
certainly not themselves, and you get the feeling that they may be wrestling with some 
internal struggle. Will this affect their ability to cope with stressful situations? Make a DC 
13 + tier Wisdom (Insight) check. If unsuccessful, the character makes their next 3 d20 
rolls with disadvantage. If successful, you talk with the character and attempt to get to the 
bottom of the problem. Make a DC 11 + tier Charisma (Persuasion) check. If successful, 
they are able to get over the problem and focus on the task at hand (use keywords to 
determine what the problem was, or roll on an event meaning or threads table if you have 
one). If unsuccessful, the character makes their next 2 d20 rolls at disadvantage. 
74 
A strong, rushing body of water courses through this area. You can see some object at the 
midway point, a statue or some other heavy object which the water cannot move. To 
inspect this object, make a DC 15 + tier Strength (Athletics) check. If successful, you 
successfully inspect the object. Roll on an event meaning or keywords table to provide you 
with some detail as to what it is and whether it appears to be connected to your quest (add a 
clue point if it does). 
75 
Strange plants grow here that appear to bear spores on their flowers. You have no idea 
what effect these spores will have if disturbed and dispersed into the air. Make a DC 15 + 
tier Dexterity (Stealth) check to move through this area. If you fail, you inadvertently 
knock one or more of the plants and disperse these spores into the air. Make a DC 15 + tier 
Constitution saving throw. If unsuccessful, take (tier x 2) d8 poison damage. 
76 
You arrive at a strange monument. It is a robed female who holds a priceless-looking gem 
in her hand, balanced on her fingertips. Examining the statue closely, you see that the arm 
appears to be weighted, a lever of some sort. Removing it (if you wish to do so) will be very 
tricky and might require replacing it with a stone or other object of similar weight. To 
attempt to do this make a DC 17 + tier Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.  
If successful, roll a d4 to discover what you have gained: 
(1) Garnet - 100gp  
(2) Topaz - 500 gp  
(3) Star ruby - 1000 gp  
(4) Diamond - 5000 gp. 
77 
You can hear a knocking sound coming from somewhere ahead. Is it the sound of someone 
hammering? Make a DC 11 + tier Wisdom (Perception) check to discern more about the 
nature of the sound. If successful, roll keywords to provide more information.

78 
You enter a strange area where a dark, bluish energy suffuses everything. If there are living 
things here, they are struggling for life, and you yourself feel lethargic, as if you are falling 
under some enchantment or curse. 
Make a DC 14 + tier Intelligence (Arcana) check to discern more about the nature of this 
phenomenon. If successful, you have advantage on a subsequent DC 14 + tier Constitution 
saving throw which you must make now. If unsuccessful, take one level of exhaustion.  
79 
You see an altar where a relic of some kind rests on a pedestal. Coming near, however, you 
find it difficult to proceed, to get near this relic. Then, painted on the floor at the base of the 
pedestal you see several runes. Make a DC 14 + tier Arcana check to discern the nature of 
these apparently protective runes. Perhaps, if you are able to recall some lore about them, 
you can find a way to deactivate this magical field.  
If you are successful in the Arcana check, and then you have a spell such as dispel magic, roll 
twice on the Uncommon Magic Items table (p.180) and choose the result.  
80 
You find strange markings here in a language you don’t understand. Did some ancient 
civilization live here at some stage in the distant past? Make a DC 14 + tier Intelligence 
(History) check. If successful, you have advantage on all Intelligence checks for the 
remainder of this quest. 
81 
You find an odd device embedded in the rock. It is unclear what this does, but it obviously 
has some purpose. Make a DC 14 + tier Intelligence (Investigation) check. If successful, 
choose one of the following effects, depending on the context of your quest. Or roll a d4. 
(1) You discover a secret door. 
(2) You discover the entrance to a dungeon. 
(3) A trap, locked door or other feature encountered somewhere nearby is disabled / 
opened. 
(4) Use keywords to determine the effect. 
82 
Outdoors: The terrain is strange in this area, as if some beast or natural phenomenon has 
altered it in some way. Make a DC 11 + tier Intelligence (Nature) check. If successful, use 
keywords to determine why the terrain here is the way it is.  
Indoors: Re-roll for a different skill challenge if you wish. 
83 
You discover a body dressed in strange ceremonial garb, as of a priest or acolyte. Make a 
DC 12 + tier Intelligence (Religion) check. If successful, you have advantage on 
Intelligence checks related to cults and religion for the rest of this quest, and you cannot be 
surprised by cultists or other enemies of a religious nature.  
84 
Your enemy, if you even know what they are, seems elusive. No matter how you search for 
them, the web they have woven is strange and at times hard to decipher. There are traces of 
their handiwork that you have found, but nothing that allows you to know their true 
motive. You take a moment to stop and consider what their master plan might be, based on 
all that you have seen so far.  
Make a DC 14 + tier Wisdom (Insight) check. If successful, gain an Inspiration. 
85 
You feel a twinge in your neck. For some reason, perhaps you have not been drinking 
enough water or have not eaten for a while, you feel a splitting headache coming on. It is so 
severe that you fear it might compromise your prowess in battle.  
Make a DC 12 + tier Wisdom (Medicine) check. If unsuccessful, make your next three 
attack rolls at disadvantage. You may make the Medicine check with advantage if you have 
an herbalism kit. 
86 
You have a strange feeling that you can’t shake. It’s as if eyes are watching you, from 
somewhere hidden perhaps.  
Make a DC 14 + tier Wisdom (Perception) check. If successful, roll a d4.  
(1) Someone is watching from a concealed place nearby, possibly a hidden room.

(2) Someone is observing you magically. 
(3) Someone is using a tiny creature as a familiar to spy on you. 
(4) A member of your party is carrying an object which someone has cast a spell on 
that enables them to track your movements. 
Decide what in-game effects this result has on your quest. 
87 
The rigours of travel and adventure are taking their toll and you and any companions you 
have with you. It might also be some sort of enchantment, but all of a sudden you are struck 
with a ravenous hunger and parched thirst. If you have not eaten today, you must 
immediately take rations. If you have no rations, you will have to forage. Make a Wisdom 
(Survival) check, DC 9 + tier if outdoors, DC 14 + tier if indoors. On a fail, take one level of 
exhaustion.  
88 
You reach a barrier where a spectral figure bars the way forward. “Stop, travelers!” it 
addresses you. “You shall go no further!” 
This spectral figure is blocking the way. You must either succeed on a DC 17 + tier 
Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check. Otherwise, based on your PC tier, 
encounter the following: 
• 
Tier 1: 1 x shadow per character (if level 1, max 1 shadow per party) 
• 
Tier 2: 1 x wight per character 
• 
Tier 3: 1 x wraith per character 
• 
Tier 4: 1 x alhoon per character 
89 
Off to the side of your path, a glimmer catches your eye. You move closer and see small 
crystals that catch the light and appear to glow with a strange radiance. A DC 14 + tier 
Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that these are arcane crystals. A spellcaster can take one 
of these, and cast 2 level 1 or 1 level 2 spell into it for later use, following the same rules as 
a ring of spell storing. You find 1d4 crystals. The crystal can only be used once in this way. If 
you fail the Arcana check, you are not privy to this knowledge and would not know the 
crystals can be used in this way. Each crystal can also be sold as a common magic item (if 
unused). 
90 
You hear a cracking sound, and look up to see a large rock or piece of masonry falling 
towards you! Make a DC 10 + tier Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, 
taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save. 
91 
Your immediate area is a bit of a mess, with small to medium piles of detritus lying on the 
floor. A DC 12 + tier Intelligence (Investigation) check will reveal a small chest containing 
a CR 1 treasure hoard. 
92 
Is there an NPC with you? If not, reroll. If so, continue reading. 
You get the feeling (possibly as a result of certain recent events) that the NPC 
accompanying you is not telling you everything they know. Make a DC 12 + tier Wisdom 
(Insight) check. If successful, make an oracle roll (with the likelihood at “likely”) to 
determine if they do know something else (possibly related to your quest). If they do, roll 
for keywords to determine the nature of this information. 
93 
You encounter a shrine to an obscure god, surrounded by ritual offerings and several 
corpses. Make a DC 13 + tier Intelligence (Religion) check to discern the nature of this 
dark god, their name, and possibly the motives behind this horrific ritual. If successful, you 
will have advantage on checks to determine surprise against cultists or other beings 
engaged in similar rituals, for the rest of this quest.  
94 
Strange animals are dwelling a little way ahead, but are as yet unaware of your presence. 
They appear harmless, but could stampede if alarmed. Make a DC 15 + tier Dexterity 
(Stealth) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to move through this area. If you fail, the

---

## Page 150

150 
 
beasts panic and stampede, looking to escape. In that case, make a DC 16 + tier Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check to get out of the way or take (tier x 3) d6 
bludgeoning damage.  
95 
You reach a door which has a magical talking mouth. It demands you tell it one truth and 
one lie, and it has to guess which is truth. It tells you, if you succeed in fooling it, it will 
open and reveal its secrets. If you are outdoors, you encounter a structure with this door as 
the entrance.  
Make a DC 15 + tier Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed, you gain entrance 
through the door. Use keywords to determine what secrets you gain access to here - 
something directly relevant to your quest.  
96 
You find a flickering portal - a shimmering rip in the air. The image behind it stutters and 
changes from moment to moment. If you succeed on a DC 14 + tier Intelligence (Arcana) 
check you can stabilise the portal for a few seconds to travel anywhere you want within 100 
miles (If you fail the check by 5 or more, you end up in a random location 100 miles away). 
97 
You come across a small band of four men encamped around a cooking fire. On seeing you 
one of them calls out, “Greetings good friend! It has been a long time since we have been in 
a stranger’s company and have grown quite bored with each other. Please, come join us and 
tell us of your adventures.” Make a DC 11 + tier Charisma (Performance) check to entertain 
the men with stories of your exploits. On a success the group becomes friendly to you and 
gives you some information about a new or current quest (roll on keyword or event 
meaning tables). On a fail, one of the men draws his bandit’s scimitar and points it in your 
direction as the others circle around you. “Hmmm....not all that impressive I’m afraid. Now 
give us all your gold!” Encounter (tier x 1) thugs.  
98 
You feel an ancient force here, but cannot tell whether it is benign or malevolent. Make a 
DC 13 + tier Intelligence (Arcana) check. If successful, roll on the Boon table (p.152). If 
unsuccessful, roll a d4. (1-3) Roll on Bane table (p.157). (4) Roll on Boon table (p.152). 
99 
You find a ring. Make a DC 15 + tier Intelligence (Arcana) check to recognize that this is a 
ring of mind shielding. There is a random NPC's soul within the ring and If any character 
decides to put it on, the NPC's soul may interact telepathically with the mind of the 
character wearing it. If the character succeeded on the check, they will be aware that the 
ring is causing this, otherwise they will simply hear voices and may think they are losing 
their mind. This might continue until they come across someone (such as a mage) who can 
tell them why they are hearing these voices, and identify the ring. 
Once per day, the wearer may try a DC 19 + tier Persuasion check to convince the soul of 
the random NPC to depart for the afterlife and vacate the ring. Regardless of there being a 
soul or not in the ring, the character wearing it can benefit from all of its characteristics. 
The player can decide whether completing a side quest will be enough to convince the soul 
within the ring to depart for the afterlife. 
100 
Time passes, and you find you have nodded off and woken up inside some sort of dream 
world. Make a DC 19 + tier Wisdom saving throw to escape immediately and wake up in 
the real world. If you fail this saving throw, you must perform a minor quest within this 
world. All skills and rolls are based on your Charisma modifier. You have to find the way 
out of this world, which means making a new DC 19 + tier Wisdom saving throw at the 
beginning of each new scene or story point. Everything you see is strange, especially the 
monsters. The rules of science do not necessarily apply.

Bane Table 
 
When to use these? You can use these at any time, when an oracle determines you have encountered 
a boon, or by any method you deem appropriate (perhaps a god grants you a boon and you need to 
know what it is). They are also included in the 6d12 system, the Battlemap Crawl and Realm Crawl 
systems, and as a rollable result on the random encounter tables. 
 
d100 RESULT 
1-2 
Curse of Shar  
The goddess of dark, night, and forgetfulness roams this area, and you have unknowingly 
been touched by her malevolent energy. One random player must make a DC 12 + tier 
Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they are under the effects of a level 1 bane spell, but 
will not be aware of this until the next combat encounter begins. During your next combat, 
deduct 1d4 from all attack rolls and saving throws. You may repeat this saving throw at 
the end of each of your turns, ending the effect on a success.  
3-4 
Dark Foreboding 
You have been assailed by a haunting vision or premonition. Choose a character to make a 
DC 17 + tier Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, then for the rest of this quest that 
character has disadvantage when making attack rolls against one of the following monster 
types [d8]  
(1) Aberration (2) Beast (3) Construct (4) Elemental (5) Fiend (6) Humanoid (7) 
Monstrosity (8) Undead. 
5-6 
Moment of Weakness 
Any resistances you are able to gain, as a result of traits, feats or other effects (for example, 
a barbarian’s resistance to certain damage while raging), are gone during the next combat 
encounter. Other aspects of the trait or feat are unaffected (for example, the barbarian 
would still get the +2 damage bonus from raging, just not the resistance). 
7-8 
Forgot to Stretch 
You woke up this morning feeling a little bit stiff, perhaps after recent exertions. You have 
a -1 to any Dexterity-based checks and saving throws until you complete your next long 
rest.  
9-10 
Rumbling from Below 
Something you ate recently is not agreeing with you. You have a -2 to Constitution-based 
checks and saving throws until you complete your next long rest. 
11-
12 
Thieving Rascals 
Someone’s been into your pack while your back was turned! Choose or roll for a random 
possession to remove from your inventory, or deduct 1d10x10 gp. 
13-
14 
Dancing Lights 
Not far off, you see strange dancing lights which attract you with their playful movement. 
You cannot help but feel drawn towards them. 
Make a DC 9 + tier Wisdom saving throw or suffer one of the following effects (your 
choice): 
Lose 1 Clue Point 
Lose an Inspiration 
Suffer 2d6 psychic damage

15-
16 
Resistance is Futile 
Some foul arcane trickery is afoot. Any resistances you have to particular damage types are 
null until you complete the next long rest. This applies to all race and class features and 
traits.  
17-
18 
Curse of Poor Speech 
Somehow you have lost your voice! Perhaps you’ve been arguing with your fellow 
adventurers, are a bit run down, or are just on the wrong end of some mischievous sorcery, 
but whatever the case your voice has taken on a raspy and unpleasant tone. You have 
disadvantage on all Charisma checks that rely on speech until you finish your current 
quest. Also, whenever you attempt to cast a spell with a verbal component, you must make 
a DC 11 + tier Constitution check. If you fail, you cannot cast the spell (but you do not lose 
the slot).  
19-
20 
Weakest Link 
For some reason, your courage has deserted you somewhat, and the very idea of combat 
seems daunting. You wonder if your companions will notice. 
During the next combat encounter, your character will not be able to participate in any 
flanking manoeuvres.  
21-
22 
Arcane Memory Loss 
Try as you might, your spells are not coming to you as easy as they normally do. Perhaps 
it is the wine you drank last night, but your mental acuity is somewhat less than normal.  
During the next combat encounter, you can either cast a spell or cantrip as your main 
action, but you cannot cast a spell or cantrip as a bonus action.  
23-
24 
Brain Fog 
Something is clouding your judgment and decision making. Until the end of this quest, you 
have a penalty of -1 on Wisdom- and Intelligence-based checks and saving throws. 
25-
26 
Deserted by Luck 
You feel as if the entire cosmos is bent against your good fortune. Make your next three 
saving throws at disadvantage.  
27-
28 
Lead in Your Boots 
You just can’t seem to shake this lethargy. The next time you roll initiative, your speed is 
halved for the first two rounds. 
29-
30 
Fear the Reaper 
Your fate teeters on a knife edge. If at any time during the remainder of this quest you are 
forced to make death saving throws, you automatically fail the first one. 
31-
32 
Clumsy 
You just can’t seem to co-ordinate yourself today. You have disadvantage on all Dexterity-
based checks and saving throws until you finish your next combat encounter. 
33-
34 
Slow Healer 
You immediately begin to feel a little sickly. Until the end of this quest, when you regain 
hit points through magical means (such as spells or healing potions) you only regain half 
the hit points bestowed. 
35-
36 
Berserker 
You feel a sudden, irrational anger against your enemies. The next time you are hit in 
combat by an enemy, you go berserk against that enemy, immediately making an extra 
attack at disadvantage vs that enemy. The same enemy then has advantage on their next 
attack roll against you. This only occurs once.

37-
38 
Nightmares 
You begin to be tormented by disturbing visions of horrific creatures. The next time you 
encounter a non-humanoid enemy, make a DC 17 + tier Wisdom saving throw. On a fail 
you are immediately frightened. You may repeat the saving throw at the beginning of each 
of your turns, ending the effect on a success. The bane then ends. 
39-
40 
Insomniac 
You feel a bizarre, washed-out tiredness. The next time you attempt to take a long rest, 
make a DC 14 + tier Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you get a terrible sleep. 
You must choose one class feature to not refresh, and after replenishing hit points, roll (tier 
x d4) hit dice and deduct this from your hit point total. 
41-
42 
Weak Hitter 
Your main attack (be it weapon or spell-based) has lost some of its gusto. During the next 
combat encounter, deduct (tier x d4) damage from each of your weapon’s damage rolls.  
43-
44 
Forgetful Caster 
If you are a non-casting class, reroll.  
You have temporarily forgotten one of your spells. Choose or randomly select one of your 
spells (not a cantrip). You have temporarily forgotten this spell until after your next long 
rest. 
45-
46 
Tired in Your Bones 
All this adventuring seems to have taken it out of you - or perhaps you are just coming 
down with a cold. Your hit point maximum is reduced by 5 until after you complete your 
next long rest. 
47-
48 
Curse of Withering 
Some ancient curse lingers here! You immediately age 10 years, and can feel it in all the 
bones of your body. Immediately take one level of exhaustion. This curse can be removed 
with a remove curse spell. The exhaustion can be removed as per normal rules. 
49-
50 
Rust Never Sleeps 
If you are wearing metal armour, you look down to notice that a significant portion has 
become afflicted with some kind of rapidly advancing rust. It is repairable at a blacksmith’s, 
but for now subtract 1 from your AC until you can find a blacksmith to repair this. The 
repairs should cost you around 15 gp.  
51-
52 
Jammed Crossbow 
If you do not use a crossbow, re-roll. 
If you are using a crossbow, you see that some fault has afflicted it. From now on, 
whenever you roll a nat 1 on an attack roll, the crossbow seizes and you must spend an 
action clearing the jam. You can fix this as soon as you can find a weaponsmith. The 
repairs should cost you around 20 gp.

Wild Magic Everywhere 
If you are not a caster, re-roll.  
Somehow you seem to be the recipient of some kind of wild magic curse. During the next 
combat encounter, you cast a spell, make a DC 14 + tier check using your spellcasting 
ability score. If you fail the check, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random 
magical effect (PHB p.104). 
55-
56 
NPC Exhausted 
If you do not have an NPC or sidekick, re-roll. 
“I can’t go any further,” your NPC says, dropping to their knees. “How do you keep this up, 
all day every day?”

Your travelling companion seems unaccustomed to such exertion. Have the NPC/sidekick 
make a DC 14 + tier Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they take one level of 
exhaustion. If they succeed, their hit point maximum is reduced by 10 until they complete a 
long rest. 
57-
58 
Curse of Madness 
Some ancient malediction infects this area. You feel the tendrils of madness creeping into 
your mind… 
Every character must make a DC 12 + tier Wisdom saving throw. If they fail the save, they 
make a roll on the short-term madness table (DMG, p.259). If they roll a nat 1 then have 
them roll on the long-term madness table (DMG, p.260).  
59-
60 
Vulnerable 
Dark gods aligned with your enemies have cursed you! Until the end of the next combat 
encounter, you have vulnerability to [d6] (1-2) Bludgeoning (3-4) Piercing (5-6) Slashing 
damage. 
61-
62 
Magic Susceptibility 
A curse has made you susceptible to arcane attacks. You have disadvantage on your next 
three saving throws vs. spells or other magical effects. This curse ends with your current 
quest. 
63-
64 
Elemental Susceptibility 
Until the end of the current quest, you are vulnerable to one of the following damage types: 
[d4] (1) Fire (2) Cold (3) Lightning (4) Force. 
65-
66 
Unproficient 
Some malignant force clouds your brain, making you lose expertise in something you were 
previously a master of. Until the end of the current quest, you lose proficiency in one of 
your skills. Count the number of skills you are proficient in and devise a dice roll to 
randomly determine which skill you have lost proficiency in. This effect ends at the 
conclusion of the current quest (take note on your character sheet so you can restore your 
skill later.  
67-
68 
Rusty Weapon 
Reroll if you do not possess any steel weapons.  
One non-magical steel weapon in your possession has become rusty and does not do as 
much damage as it used to. If you roll a nat 1 with this weapon it breaks and cannot be 
used until you find a weaponsmith. Until then, deduct d4 from each of your damage rolls 
with this weapon. This effect lasts until you can find a weaponsmith. The cost to repair will 
be 10 gold pieces.  
69-
70 
Kelemvor’s Wrath 
The god of death and justice is annoyed that you are seemingly doing his work for him. 
Roll a d6 and take note of effects.  
(1-2) Until the end of the quest, healing spells are only half as effective. 
(3-4) The next character to make a death save does so at disadvantage 
(5-6) The next time you reduce a monster to 0 hp, you reduce it to 1 hp instead.  
71-
72 
Unsure of Foot 
Fatigue and dark forces are conspiring against you, dogging your steps. During the next 
combat encounter, before every movement, make a DC 13 + tier Dexterity saving throw. 
On a fail, your character can only move up to half their speed. 
73-
74 
Tainted Potion 
If you possess no potions, re-roll.

Some sort of mould has altered the composition of one of your potions (select potion 
randomly if possible). 
When you use this potion, instead of working normally, it triggers a roll on the Variant: 
Mixing Potions table on p.140 of Dungeon Master’s Guide. 
75-
76 
Conspicuous 
You and your allies stick out like a sore thumb in this environment. Perhaps your enemy 
has alarms in place, or perhaps they have heightened senses. Whatever the case, remaining 
undetected in here is nigh on impossible. For the remainder of this quest, your party has 
disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and your allies have advantage on Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks.  
77-
78 
Heightened Danger 
If you are not using the 6d12 system, re-roll. 
Things are starting to get more perilous, whether you are aware of it or not. Add 1 to 
every die in your next 4 6d12 rolls. 
79-
80 
Bestow Curse 
An unseen enemy has afflicted you with a bestow curse spell. During your next combat 
encounter, choose a member of your party to be affected by this spell.  
81-
82 
Darkness Descends 
The area you are in is suddenly affected by a darkness spell. Any enemies are not affected by 
this spell. The effect ends at the edge of the current room or area you are exploring. 
83-
84 
Bane 
An unseen enemy has afflicted you with a bane spell. During your next combat encounter, 
choose a member of your party to be affected by this spell.  
85-
86 
Command Curse 
Some sort of ancient ritual was performed here. One of your party (determine randomly) 
must make a DC 17 + tier Wisdom saving throw, or become the subject of an enchantment 
spell which will cause them to carry out a task, unbeknown to the rest of the party (and 
possibly even to themselves, at least consciously). Use keywords and oracle to determine 
the nature of this task, which should fit within the context of the current quest. This 
ancient curse does not conform to any known spell. They may repeat the Wisdom saving 
throw when they are just about to consummate the task.  
87-
88 
Illusory Area 
If you are not using the 6d12 system, reroll. 
The current area you are in turns out to be nothing more than a very real-seeming illusion. 
If using the 6d12 system, reroll, adding 5 to every dice except the treasure dice. If enemies 
are generated, your characters are surprised in the first round.  
89-
90 
Invisible Trap 
You have blundered into a trap, which has been concealed with some sort of invisibility 
spell. Roll on either the Wilderness or Standard Trap table (pp.40-41). Do not roll in the 
notice DC column. However, you will still be able to make a saving throw to avoid the 
effects of the trap (e.g., Dexterity save for a spear trap). 
91-
92 
Hallucinatory Mould 
Some sort of mould has released its spores into the air, causing you to hallucinate and see 
double. It appears that there are two of each of your party members, and this will also 
apply to any enemies you see.  
During the next combat encounter, every time you make an attack roll, make a DC 19 + 
tier Constitution saving throw. If you fail, make the attack roll at disadvantage. If you 
succeed, the effect ends at that point.

Curse of Hideousness 
Some ancient curse has caused your visage to alter, making you hideously ugly! You have 
disadvantage on all Charisma-based checks. This effect can be ended with a remove curse 
spell. Perhaps you can find a mage in a nearby settlement, or a caster in your party can 
learn this spell next time you stop for a long rest. 
95-
96 
Slow Healer 
Some effect has caused your regenerative properties to slow down. You only regain half 
your hit points on a long rest. Your hit points can still be restored to maximum with spells 
or potions, but a long rest will only restore you to half your maximum hit points. 
97-
98 
Speechless 
Randomly determine a character in your party. This character loses the ability to speak due 
to an ancient curse on this area. Obviously, this affects casters more than other classes, but 
regardless this effect can be ended with a remove curse spell, or when your current quest is 
concluded. 
99-
100 
Arch Enemy 
Randomly determine a character from your party. That character, through their heroic 
deeds or misdeeds, has attracted the attention of a being from the hellish planes. Use 
keywords and oracle rolls to determine the nature of this being, but regardless, until this 
being is defeated it will prove to be a major source of consternation to the character.

Roll a 1d8 and a 1d100. When you have your result, use a CTRL+F search to quickly go to the 
number. The way the die roll is set up below means that you can quickly read the rolls. E.g., 3 on a d8 
and a 42 on a d100 = 342. The only time that you don’t read the number on the d8 as the hundreds is 
when it hits 8. That means it's in the 0-100 range.  
Note: Some of these words do recur, as they have wide application in creating encounters.

Chapter 4-5 
Fate Rolls & Life Events 
 
Your characters journey through your world, 
encountering monsters, NPCs, slaying villains 
and rescuing the poor and downtrodden. But 
what goes on in the background? As they are 
out there, completing their adventures, the 
world goes on around them, and things happen 
that influence their lives.   
In addition to the tables included herein, you 
should also check out the This Is Your Life 
tables, which feature on pp.61-73 of Xanathar’s 
Guide to Everything. In particular, the Life 
Events tables provide an alternative to the 
tables below, if you’re looking for something 
different. 
Another excellent resource that could be used 
for this purpose is The Deck of Tales by 
Larcenous Designs. This is a card deck that 
provides provocative iconography that, like 
keywords, can suggest a number of narrative 
directions. 
I was excited when this idea occurred to me as 
the element of roleplay is scant in the solo 
format. This brings some real-world events 
into the PCs lives, which they usually will need 
to respond to. The procedure for determining 
these events is as follows.  
Every morning, roll a d100 Fate Roll for each of 
your PCs. This d100 roll will determine 
whether a Life Event happens to them! 
Sometimes, if you are running two PCs, one PC 
may have nothing happen to them, but the 
other is the result of a cataclysm or miracle, 
which the first PC will feel the results of, 
becoming a recipient of that event themselves, 
as if they had rolled successfully for that.  
 
Delivery Method 
Some of these results constitute life-altering 
news. As such, we need to give some thought as 
to how the news was delivered. There might be 
suitable answers based on your setting. For 
example, in my homebrew world, there is a lot 
of planar travel, so a courier could track down a 
party’s location by scrying (through a mage 
perhaps) and then travel via portal to the 
location to deliver the news. Use oracle rolls 
and keywords for ideas if you wish, but make it 
fit with the theme of your campaign.

you! 
11 
A local noble has challenged you to a duel, for some slight, real or imagined

you as a major role model. 
2 
Positive news related to your career 
3 
A romantic interest is reciprocating your attentions. Re-roll if not relevant. 
4 
Choose the one which you think is most appropriate. 1: A young person is gravitating

8 
You discover a portal which leads to somewhere you’ve been wanting to visit for a while 
now.

travel to claim this treasure, however. But it’s not going anywhere. 
10 
You meet a person who has heard of you and a particular problem that you have. They have 
searched you out because they are passionate about helping you solve this problem.

A PC or NPC of your choice who has died is miraculously brought back to life.

You discover a long-lost or unknown relative (possibly a twin?) that you did not you had. 
And they have a fascinating backstory, one which is remarkably similar to your own. 
14 
You gain a temporary insight into the future - a prophetic vision. A mystery regarding your 
current quest is revealed to you.  
15 
The realm wants to bestow some sort of honour on you, in recognition of your brave 
exploits! 
16 
A curse or affliction affecting you or someone you care about is removed. 
17 
The gods have blessed you with uncommon prowess. Increase an ability score of your choice 
by 1.  
18

Does Your Character Actually Know? 
Your character may be travelling somewhere far distant from their homeland, and so it may be some 
time before they receive this news. Or, perhaps you decide that when you make the roll is the time 
when you receive the news, even though that thing could have happened days or even weeks before. 
If you need to randomise when an event occurred, then roll on the following table.

Occasionally you need to roll for a random magic item. Here are all the magic items from Dungeon 
Master’s Guide, Xanathar’s Guide to Everything and Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, arranged into tables 
by rarity.  
To make things a bit more interesting (and to make die rolls easier) a handful of the more lacklustre 
items have been removed.

Random Quest Name Table 
 
The table below is designed to suggest possible quests through the combination of words. Roll 3 
times with a d100, or simply choose some terms. It may take a few attempts, or a bit of a tweak for 
you to get something that appeals to you. The idea here is to get you thinking outside of the box. 
Rescue of the Corrupted Beastman? Hunt for the Burning Dragon? Create a story around your title that 
makes sense, and focus on each word as you extrapolate the meaning of the story. Haunting of the 
Forsaken City? What is it haunted by, and why? Who was it forsaken by? How big is the city? Who 
currently inhabits the city? You get the idea.  
Generate a quest name and see what stories suggest themselves! Reroll if a particular term doesn’t 
make sense.

Random Item / Relic Name Table 
 
Introduction
It is surprising how often, in the course of solo 
play, it becomes necessary to generate a 
random item or relic of some sort.  
Roll four times on this table to furnish the 
name of a particular relic that might be the 
object of a quest or rumour. Reroll if a 
particular result doesn’t make sense, or is 
redundant in some way (absorbing 
absorption?). If you find the results from the 
table below too long-winded, a recommended 
option is to omit Term 3. You could also insert 
the name of a legendary character somewhere 
in the item name for added quest-based flavour. 
Add conjunctions, pronouns, pluralization, and 
whatever else is necessary to make the item’s 
name make grammatical sense. And the name 
should also suggest what powers the relic has 
as well. 
For added detail, consult the Special Features 
tables in the DMG (pp.141-143) to give your 
item some minor powers. You may also want to 
homebrew it as a level-appropriate magic item - 
be careful not to make it too overpowered. 
Another idea to try is rolling for three different 
items, then choosing the one that makes the 
most sense given your current quest.

Chapter 5-1 
Running Combat  
and Monster Tactics 
 
Introduction 
One of the trickiest aspects of running a solo 
game is the issue of how to handle monsters in 
combat. The author has sampled many systems 
to spice up solo combat, trying to get it beyond 
simply a style of move-into-melee-and-bash. 
Some of the best systems out there are 
boardgame systems that provide a level of 
unpredictability to monster actions. The 
Battlemap Crawl System presented in this book 
(Chapter 1-5) aims to do this, as does the 
Random Monster AI table, below. 
 
Random Monster AI 
When an encounter is triggered, determine 
monsters using a combination of your 
dungeon’s theme, and whatever combat 
encounter generator you prefer. Then, to 
determine what they actually do each round, 
use the Random Monster AI below. This was 
first used in Solo Skirmish: The Cult of Mol’goroz 
but has been extensively tweaked since then.  
Don’t always use this AI, however. Sometimes, 
determine enemy actions using an oracle, just 
to provide a different feel. Try different 
approaches and see what works for you.  
NOTE: AOO stands for attack of opportunity.

SURRENDER (if humanoid and at less than 20% max HP) or FLEE (if at less 
than 50% hp) or TAKE COVER & MAKE RANGED ATTACKS or (if no ranged 
attacks) ATTACK 
 
Menace Points 
Menace Points are acquired whenever a 
monster is wounded by a character. An easy 
way to keep track of them is to use a spare 
d100. Set it beside your battlemap, and have it 
display the current menace points. 
 
If an enemy is wounded, add X once to 
the Menace Points score. When a final 
blow kills a monster, add X twice instead 
of once to the Menace Points score.

---

How to Calculate X 
To calculate X, add up the CRs of all monsters, 
then divide 20 by that number and round down. 
That provides your base number (X) for 
Menace Points accumulated through wounds 
inflicted on enemies. Let's look at an example 
encounter. 
 
As shown in the adjacent table, for this 
encounter X=3. That means that every time 
the PCs or an NPC allied with the PCs wounds 
an enemy, you add 3 to the Menace Points 
score. As mentioned previously, this is then 
added to the roll on the Random Monster AI 
table. 
To draw the combat out longer, you might 
want to add the optional rule that monsters can 
reduce the Menace Points score by X whenever 
they wound one of the PCs or their allies.

Determining Monster 
Targets 
To determine who the monster attacks, count 
the number of characters and devise an 
appropriate dice roll. For two characters, roll a 
d4 and divide by half (1-2=Character 1, 3-
4=Character 2). For three, use a d6. And so on. 
 
Description of Each Result 
 
1-10: Move for Tactical Advantage 
and Attack 
This result means that the monster gets itself 
into the tactical position that makes the most 
sense for it given the current situation. For 
example, if it can move and get into a flanking 
position on a character with another monster, 
then it will do that. But… perhaps not if that 
nullifies its most powerful attack, which might 
be ranged. Whatever the case, once it has 
moved so that it can do maximum damage to 
its target character, it will then attack. It will 
not make a double move, unless it has no 
ranged attacks. 
 
11-25: Shove or Help or Attack 
Whenever the work “or” appears, this means 
that, in order, you should check if something is 
applicable, then if not, move to the next option.  
For example, Shove really only makes sense if 
there are two monsters, unless this monster can 
make a melee attack as a bonus action. The 
theory is, the first monster shoves to attempt to 
make the character prone, granting advantage 
to the second monster’s attack. 
Likewise, Help doesn’t make sense if there is 
only one monster. So, if Shove and Help aren’t 
applicable, then you simply move to Attack. If 
the creature can’t attack (perhaps because it is 
too far away, then it moves and attacks, or 
makes a double move so that it can attack next 
turn. 
 
26-40: Use Secondary 
Attack/Feature or Attack 
Many monsters have two attacks, a primary 
one and then a less powerful one. This result 
means that you use the less powerful attack. If, 
however, the monster only has one attack, then 
it does that.  
 
41-60: Move & Attack nearest enemy 
using most powerful method, or 
Attack 
This result means that the monster moves (if it 
needs to) and attacks the nearest enemy using 
its most powerful method. If it cannot get close 
enough to use its most powerful method of 
attack, then it uses the next attack that makes 
sense. If it cannot make any attack, it takes 
double movement.

---

## Page 208

208 
 
61-80: Use Most Powerful Feature or 
Take Cover & Make Ranged Attack 
(if they can do so without incurring 
AOO) or Attack 
Sometimes creatures have very powerful 
abilities that need to recharge, or access to 
extremely powerful spells. If this is the case, 
the monster uses its absolute deadliest attack, 
pulling out all stops. If it cannot do this, it 
takes cover (if available) and makes a ranged 
attack, or it simply attacks using its regular 
method.  
 
81-90: Move Away to Allowance & 
Make Ranged Attack (incurring 
AOO if necessary) or Dodge 
If the monster has ranged attacks, it moves 
away to its full ability then makes a ranged 
attack. It will even do this if doing so incurs 
attacks of opportunity. If it has no ranged 
attacks, it takes the Dodge action.  
 
91-95: Flee (if Menace Points 30+ 
then Dash, incurring AOO) or Use 
Defensive Feature (e.g., healing, 
invisibility) or Make Ranged Attack 
or Hold Action 
Monsters aren’t stupid. Well, not all of them. 
Check the menace points score. If it is 30 or 
above, the monster will incur AOO to get the 
hell out of there, taking double movement.  
If the Menace Points are below 30, then the 
monster will use any defensive abilities it has, 
such as becoming invisible and moving away, 
or healing itself. If it has ranged attacks, it will 
move away to full allowance (if necessary) and 
make a ranged attack. If it cannot do any of 
these things, it will hold its action (i.e.: do 
nothing) 
 
96-100: Surrender (if humanoid and 
at less than 20% max HP) or Flee (if 
at less than 50% hp) or Take Cover & 
Make Ranged Attacks or (if no 
ranged attacks) Attack 
If the monster has dropped to less than 20% of 
its maximum hp, it will surrender if humanoid, 
or flee if it is some other monster and at below 
50% hp. 
If neither of these apply, the monster will take 
cover and make ranged attacks. Failing all of 
this, it will simply attack using its regular 
method.  
 
Determining Monster 
Types 
Use the following table when a need arises to 
determine a random monster type, such as 
when you generate a random encounter with no 
details, or if you just need to generate a 
monster to populate a particular quest. Re-roll 
if the result does not suit the environment or 
particular flavour of the quest (or perhaps come 
up with an interesting reason why that 
particular monster is present).

Using Oracles In 
Combat 
In place of the Random Monster AI, an oracle 
(such as the one included in Chapter 1-8) can be 
used to determine what monsters do. When 
using an oracle in this way, take into account 
the monster’s motivation (perhaps as 
established by the story so far, or by any 
available monster lore) and other factors. 
If one monster or NPC is commanding a large 
force (even an NPC on your side, such as a 
veteran commanding a squadron of town 
guards) then you could use the oracle to 
determine how they direct their subordinates to 
act. Other factors can come into play here. Are 
the minions/subordinates willing to accept this 
command? Perhaps a Persuasion check is 
necessary. In this way, a whole story can 
emerge around the events of a battle. 
You could use the oracle to determine whether 
the enemy is on guard (harder to creep up on) 
or currently distracted. 
 
 
Using Skill Checks to 
Determine Events in 
Battle 
There are numerous events where a skill check 
is appropriate to determine a battle 
event. Check out some examples below. 
 
EXAMPLE 
SITUATION 
SKILL CHECK 
Creeping up on 
the enemy 
Have your party make 
a Stealth check, with 
the DC being the 
enemies’ passive 
Perception (use the 
highest one).  
A commander 
issuing orders to 
his regiment 
Persuasion check, with 
the DC being the 
soldiers’ Wisdom score 
A PC trying to 
Persuade an 
officer regarding 
tactics 
Persuasion check, vs a 
straight Charisma 
check from the officer 
Monster trying to 
discern where 
magic is coming 
from 
Intelligence check with 
DC being caster’s 
spellcasting ability 
score. 
 
Determining Attacks 
With Dice Rolls 
Sometimes a creature will have two different 
attacks, such as an icewind kobold which can 
make two ranged attacks, one with a javelin 
and one with dagger. You might reason that 
the kobold has quite a few daggers but only one 
javelin, and so you can use a dice roll to 
determine which it uses as its ranged attack. 
It’s more likely to use daggers, right? Unless it 
gets desperate.  
[d6] (1-4) dagger (5-6) javelin.

Chapter 5-2 
Villain / BBEG Generator 
 
The tools presented in this chapter are 
designed to assist you in creating the BBEG, or 
“Big Bad Evil Guy” in your quest. This is 
another one of those situations where you may 
have, as pseudo-DM, an idea of who the main 
villain is, but your characters do not. Really, 
there are two approaches.  
 
First Approach: Reveal 
the Villain Over the 
Course of the 
Adventure 
As you may have gathered from reading these 
books, I often advocate an approach to freeform 
solo adventuring where you let the clues and 
events encountered during the course of the 
adventure determine the final outcome of the 
adventure, including the main villain. There’s a 
bit of an art to this. In general, it refers to your 
characters discovering certain clues, and the 
player coming up with an ending / final 
encounter that ties all these loose ends 
together.  
 
Second Approach: 
Determine the Villain 
Early On 
The other approach to generating your villain 
is to create them early on, and then reveal this 
villain to your characters as they journey 
through the adventure. Of course, this ruins the 
surprise a little bit for the player, but it does 
help you to create a more well-rounded villain.  
 
Other Tools 
The Dungeon Master’s Guide has a huge range of 
resources to help round out your villain. 
Chapter 4: Creating Nonplayer Characters is 
essential reading in this regard. There is a 
section on NPCs which includes many useful 
tables, and later in the chapter a section 
specifically on villains (pp.94-97).  
Tome of Adventure Design also contains a large 
section entitled “The Villain’s Plan” which is 
excellent for fleshing out villain motivations 
(pp.27-52) 
 
BBEG Principles 
• 
They must be hard to defeat.  
• 
They need to make sense in the context of 
the story. 
• 
They need motivations and a backstory. 
• 
They will usually have accomplices.  
• 
They will be more rounded out if you give 
them some characteristics, flaws etc. 
 
What Type of Monster 
Are They? 
You could randomly determine your villain’s 
monster type by using the Random Monster 
Type table (p.208), or you could have a look at 
what nature of clues your characters have 
encountered so far in order to determine this. 
There may be some items from the list of clues 
below that point to a particular type of 
monster, or perhaps these will be close enough 
to the clues you have found to suggest 
something similar.  
 
A Note on Constructs, 
Oozes & Plants 
Although I have included constructs in the 
table below, it is rare that you will find a 
construct as a BBEG, simply because they don’t 
generally have any free will or personal 
motivations. However, perhaps you might come 
across a cowardly artificer who pits you against 
a powerful golem, and this could form your 
final encounter.  
A similar situation arises with oozes and plants. 
As most of them are not fully sentient, it is hard 
to bestow on them many of the traits that make 
a villain memorable. With the exception of evil 
treants, perhaps...

What’s Their Plan? 
Every villain worth their salt has a plan. Here’s a list of six broad concepts for villainous motivation. 
The Monster Types column offers suggestions about what type of creatures might pursue the stated 
plan. 
Roll once for a simple plot, or twice for something a bit more complicated. After you have a general 
direction, roll for some keywords in order to give your concept a bit more detail.

General Villainous Motivation Table 
d6 MOTIVATION 
MONSTER 
TYPES 
1 
Usurpation / Overthrow 
This general plan could involve anything from overthrowing the government or the 
monarchy, to rallying armies and invading a kingdom, or even just a local creature or 
dark lord aiming to conquer and control a town. This plan will need to be broken 
down into stages, however, and any intelligent creature will realize this. As with all of 
these, add keywords for flavour. 
All 
2 
Acting as Agent 
The villain may be the head of some kind of cult or guild. Through coercion, violence, 
manipulation, brainwashing or any other means of persuasion, they are attempting to 
bring as many individuals into their fold as possible. Perhaps they consider 
themselves to be a godlike figure, or perhaps they are acting as the emissary for an 
ancient (perhaps even forgotten) god of some kind. They could even see themselves as 
agents of change to bring an ancient prophecy into effect. 
Summoning is another common type of this sort of quest. The villain must enact 
some ritual in order to bring about the return of an ancient, powerful force. Or, 
perhaps they are opening a gate to another dimension or hellish plane. Either way, 
there is a definite element of madness and mayhem to this thread. 
Dragon, fey, 
fiend, giant, 
humanoid, 
undead 
3 
Change Their Own Nature 
A common motivation for villains is to change their own state to one of godhood, 
immortality or perhaps even undeath. The creature either needs to perform a ritual, 
gain an item, or prolong their life / elevate their divine status indefinitely by some 
other means. Doing so would make them undefeatable, which is not a good state of 
affairs! Discern what it is they have to do / who they have to kill / what they have to 
obtain in order to make this happen, and then use keywords to fill in the blanks.  
Aberration, 
celestial, dragon, 
fey, fiend, giant, 
humanoid, 
undead 
4 
Acquire / Keep Things or Resources 
This is perhaps a precursor to something more serious. It’s also the only kind of plot 
that a beast will become a villain within (i.e., a bear marauding livestock or something 
similar). It involves an attempt to gain control over an item or resource. Examples 
could range from a warlord taking a forest to provide timber for siege weapons. It 
could also include a sorceress stealing an ancient relic that grants her great power. 
Resource control could also mean stealing treasure of some sort, conducting a heist or 
stealing a relic. It could also mean that the creature has already obtained the resource 
/ thing, and is now trying to keep it, wielding the control that it bestows. 
Beast, dragon, 
fey, giant, 
humanoid 
5 
Creation / Proliferation 
Perhaps the villain is involved in the creation of a terrible device or war that will 
wreak utter devastation on the populace. Or perhaps they are seeking to spread a 
disease that will wipe out the populace, or create a spell so powerful that it cannot be 
allowed to exist. They may even be trying to do something as ambitious as creating 
an entire world or dimension of their own where they can imprison people. 
Dragon, fey, 
fiend, giant, 
humanoid, 
undead 
6 
Insane Obsession 
Sometimes villains are not always born that way, but through latching onto a 
particular idea or becoming obsessed with a particular notion, perpetrate evil acts 
through their obsession. E.g., Someone loses the love of their life, and then becomes 
obsessed with the idea of bringing them back from death at all costs. 
This can also include the very common motivation of revenge. A slight (real or 
imagined) or truly heinous offense or crime committed against someone (or someone 
dear to that person) can consume them to the point where their only thought is the 
destruction of the offender.

fiend, giant,

Villainous Dispositions Table 
To get an idea for what sort of disposition / nature the villain possesses, roll once or twice on this 
table. 
d12 DISPOSITION 
1 
Disregard 
This villain is so far removed from normal society that the general populous is nothing to them - irrelevant, 
really. Perhaps their true motivation lies elsewhere, on another plane, and humanoid subjects are mere pawns in 
their game. There’s almost a kind of psychopathic apathy towards life going on here. Maybe they’re not even 
actively evil, it’s just that they feel no remorse.  
2 
Insane 
This type of villain just wants to bring about mayhem. Their only desire is to set heinous events in motion and 
then watch the world burn.  
3 
Cocky / Arrogant 
This villain is so full of themself that they believe nothing will stand in their way. They have a great sense of self-
importance and may have come from a wealthy background, or perhaps the opposite and feel they have to make 
up for this. 
4 
Envious / Covetous 
This state of mind leads the villain to covet a particular thing, person, kingdom or state of being. They resent 
those who currently possess it and are bent on taking it from them, possibly destroying those people in the 
process.    
5 
Mischievous / Trickster 
This villain delights in causing misery and confusion to others, taking great delight in suffering and the 
proliferation of their own plans. Think the Joker from Batman or Loki from Norse mythology (Loki is a great 
example as he’s not always a villain).  
6 
Dark / Sombre / Sorrowful 
This villain almost sees their own dark path as inevitable, and treads it no matter the consequences, even to their 
own safety. There is a kind of gothic fatality to this mindset, a sombre resignation to the pre-ordained. 
7 
Dangerously Obsessed / Frustrated 
This person has lost most of their reason and has become obsessed with obtaining a thing, state, or person. They 
have developed tunnel vision and will not let anything stand in the way of their goal. 
8 
Outwardly Friendly / Deceptive / Con Artist 
This villain presents a magnanimous, accommodating, agreeable personality to the world, but their true nature is 
concealed. Perhaps they even keep their wrongdoings secret from the world as well, until they are exposed. 
Trickery and deceit are an integral part of their modus operandi.  
9 
Disgusted / Hateful / Contemptuous 
The majority of society disgusts this particular villain, who views everyone as beneath them, not worthy of their 
respect. They view the world contemptuously and are bent on doing everything they can to bring about its 
destruction. 
10 
Determined / Ambitious 
This personality is the province of tyrannical lords and nobles, tinpot rulers who seek to enlarge their dominion 
and their rule. They might achieve this by invading other lands, controlling resources or systematically 
destroying their enemies.  
11 
Psychopathic / Evil 
For whatever reason, this person is just out-and-out mad, bad, and dangerous to know. They care nothing for 
anyone, possibly even themselves, and just live to inflict pain. They are sadists and vindictive tyrants. Think 
Sauron from Lord of the Rings. 
12 
Matter-of-Fact 
This type of villain presents as calm and composed, but will not hesitate to be ruthless. They never allow 
themselves to get ruffled and may even be quite polite to enemies. In fact, you could almost like them… if it 
wasn’t for the heinous acts that they perpetrate.

What Are Their Methods? 
Is the villain’s plan out in the open for everyone to see? Or are they keeping their machinations 
secret, eager to get as many things in place so that by the time their plan is underway, it is too late 
for the villain’s enemies to do anything about it? 
Or, are they brazen, so sure of themselves that they openly defy their rivals to challenge them? Give 
this some thought and decide what approach they are taking. You may even choose to roll twice: a 
smart villain could well employ several methods to achieve their goals. 
 
Villainous Methods Table

6 
They work through high-powered minions and lieutenants to achieve their goals, 
manipulating from afar.

Flaws & Weaknesses 
Tread carefully when bestowing flaws and weaknesses on your main villain. It’s ok when you are 
acting as DM for a group of players, but when you possess this knowledge as a solo player, it can 
render your villain laughably easy to defeat. Perhaps consider only having this be something that 
comes into play if an oracle or a set of keywords determines it on the fly.  
However, having said that, here is a list of possible weaknesses that your villain may possess. 
 
Villain Flaws & Weaknesses Table 
d8 WEAKNESS 
1 
They are vain to a fault, and may succumb to flattery (Persuasion / Deception checks?) 
2 
They are so obsessed with their own goals that they lack the ability to see the broader picture, 
and therefore can be blindsided. 
3 
They possess some sort of phobia. 
4 
They are greedy and can easily be lured with the promise of wealth or a valuable relic 
(Persuasion / Deception). 
5 
They are paranoid and are convinced that everyone is out to betray them, including their own 
allies. This may or may not be true. 
6 
They have become so convinced of their own infallibility that they can easily miss details or 
unassuming people who possess formidable power. 
7 
A secret object is the source of the villain’s power. Control that, and you control the villain.  
8 
A particular weapon is deadly (vulnerability) towards the villain. Perhaps another quest can 
locate it.

Likeable Traits of the Villain 
Even villains have some redeeming features. For a little more depth of character, roll on this table of 
likeable traits. 
 
d8 LIKEABLE TRAIT 
1 
They possess impeccable manners and may even be quite hospitable to the party. 
2 
They have great taste in art, music and other cultural things. 
3 
They are an enemy of another enemy of the party. 
4 
They are extremely accomplished and knowledgeable in their field. 
5 
They are eloquent and witty, even though ruthless. 
6 
They observe tradition to a fault, and respect others that do so (even though they might kill 
them eventually!) 
7 
They have worked hard to get to where they are and pay respect to their mentors. 
8 
They treat their subordinates well and are eager to bring others into their fold.

Chapter 5-3 
Lair Generator 
 
This chapter aims to provide the tools to 
quickly generate a lair for a boss monster / 
villain / BBEG. It is predicated on the 
assumption that you don’t have much of an idea 
about your villain, and you need to provide a 
background against which the final encounter 
of your quest can take place. Ideally, it’s used in 
conjunction with the previous Chapter 5-2: 
Villain / BBEG Generator. 
If you have not used Chapter 5-2 to generate 
your villain, and already have a good idea of 
what their lair would be like, then just go with 
the ideas you already have. Also, another 
resource worth mentioning in this regard is 
Monster Manual. The lore on each monster 
contained in that book can provide great ideas 
regarding lairs and other monster flavour. 
Volo’s Guide to Monsters also contains a great 
selection of sample lairs which could easily be 
dropped into any solo quest.  
The tables are arranged by monster type. 
Simply find the monster type for your BBEG, 
and roll on the corresponding table to get a 
basic lair type. Then proceed to the sections 
Refining the Result and Further Detail, below.

Elemental Lairs 
Generally, an elemental does not have a lair, 
but may lurk within a system of tunnels or a 
forest (earth elemental) a volcano, a dwarven 
forge or somewhere very hot (fire elemental) 
beside a body of water, a river or flooded 
caverns (water elemental) or really anywhere 
there is open air (air elemental). They may also 
lurk on the plane associated with their 
dominant trait (e.g., Efreeti generally reside on 
the Elemental Plane of Fire) or act as 
lieutenants for another, more corporeal being 
with the power to summon and command them 
(e.g., a high-level mage).

Refining the Result 
Once you have a basic description for your 
villain lair, you could then use any number of 
tools provided within TSAT1 or TSAT2 to 
flesh it out. For example, if you get the result 
Abandoned structure, you could decide that your 
villain is holed up in an old castle, and then use 
the Castle Generator (Chapter 2-3) to provide all 
the detail.  
 
Refining the Result Table 
BASIC LAIR TYPE  
NOTES 
Abandoned structure 
Place this structure within either your current environment type (e.g., 
desert) or within an adjacent area, and then roll on the Minor Feature: 
Structure table on pp.71-72 of TSAT1.  
Alternately, you could use either the Urban Landmark table or one of the 
Merchants by District tables given in Chapter 2-1: Urban Generator of this 
book. 
Airship 
This creature inhabits an airship which doubles as both mode of 
transport and lair. How are you going to get to it, to defeat it? Perhaps 
you must wait until it lands somewhere. 
Burrow 
This could be a single cave-like hole, or a network of burrows, for which 
you could probably adapt Chapter 2-2: Natural Cavern Generator. 
Canyon / ravine 
cavern  
Cave high on a 
mountain / within a 
forest / within a 
swamp 
The classic lair type. Add a terrain feature by consulting the table below, 
Example Terrain Features for Lairs. 
Cavern system 
Use Chapter 2-2: Natural Cavern Generator from this book to provide 
detail. 
Dungeon / Tunnels 
Use either Chapter 8: Random Dungeon Generation (pp.40-56) from TSAT 
1, or Appendix A: Random Dungeons (pp.290-301) from Dungeon Master’s 
Guide. 
Encampment 
Stationed in the wilderness, this could be a travelling gypsy caravan, or 
it could be a more established settlement of tents. The best way to 
proceed here would be to use oracle and keyword rolls.

---

## Page 222

222 
 
Forest 
This could be a small copse of trees which the villain calls home, or 
perhaps a large forest where they can effectively hide for days, even 
weeks on end. This type of villain might be hard to track down. 
Forest Clearing 
This lair is an ideal spot for a fey villain to station themselves. Perhaps 
there are magical wards in place, inscribed on boulders and the trunks of 
trees. 
Forest Gully 
A rend in the earth with a forest, this gully could be an ideal place to 
avoid detection from prying eyes.  
Graveyard 
We all know undead like to hang about in these places. A specific tomb 
within a graveyard might be its preferred location, or perhaps it ranges 
about the whole area. 
Haunted House 
Within a city, out in the country, or wherever you might find it, this lair 
is frightening in and of itself! You might find all sorts of scary features 
here, and no doubt this villain has amassed an army of undead or other 
nasties as henchmen. 
Hollowed-out Tree 
This definitely suggests a fey villain. Perhaps this tree is huge and 
contains levels, like a wizard’s tower, or perhaps it is an entrance to an 
underground network of root-dungeons.  
Mage’s Tower 
The mage could be the villain here, or perhaps something they 
summoned now inhabits the abandoned tower of the mage this creature 
killed. This is fairly open to interpretation, but no doubt there will be a 
few interesting features (old festering potion cauldrons, forgotten 
glyphs) that will keep your PCs on their toes! 
Mountain / Sky / 
Planar Fortress 
Cloud giants, demons and other powerful beings like to get up high and 
look out over their dominion. Elementals as minions? And how do you 
reach these places? It’s going to take a crafty adventurer to defeat this 
villain. 
Planar Space 
This planar lair could really be anything, from a grand castle to a pocket 
dimension where the ordinary rules of reality no longer exist. The best 
way to proceed here is with keywords. 
Sewers beneath a city 
Who knows what sort of aberrations, monstrosities, guilds of corrupt 
humanoids, undead or other horrors lurk down here? A classic lair used 
by many villains who don’t mind the smell but want to stay fairly close 
to urban goings-on. 
Ship 
The ideal lair for a pirate humanoid, or perhaps an undead or fiend 
masquerading as one. You will need some sort of waterborne or airborne 
transport just to reach them.  
Structure within a 
city 
Go to Chapter 2-1: Urban Generator, and use the Merchants by District 
tables (pp.92-95) or Urban Landmark table (p.85) to discern which 
building this creature is within. 
Swamp 
Green dragons prefer swamps as lairs and generally find a nice hole 
within them. Undead are also to be found, possibly hanging around 
ruined structures that are being reclaimed by nature.  
Temple 
Deep within forests and jungles, perched on rugged coastlines or high on 
clifftops, a temple is an ideal lair for all sorts of villains.  
Tomb 
This lair could be within a graveyard or isolated out in the middle of the 
wilderness. Ideal spot for an undead lord to start summoning an army to 
invade a town or simply to terrorise the surrounding area.

Tower 
An abandoned castle, stronghold or watchtower is a great lair. How old 
is it? Is falling masonry a danger? Perhaps the floor has fallen through 
in places. And it might be quite hard to sneak up on as well.  
Treehouse 
An elven mage might choose this as a lair, or even a particularly 
innovative goblin or orc war chief. After all, it gives a good view of the 
surrounding area and also gives you the advantage of making ranged 
attacks from high ground.  
Tunnel system within 
a forest 
Use the Natural Cavern Generator (Chapter 2-2). 
Volcano 
This is a pretty epic villain lair, perhaps for someone who has immunity 
or resistance to fire damage. A red or black dragon or fire elemental 
would feel at home here.    
Wilderness 
Creature is roaming the wilderness, without any fixed abode. 
Workshop / 
Laboratory 
Perhaps situated within a city, this is the perfect lair for a mad alchemist 
or artificer, or brewer of extremely dangerous potions.  
 
Further Detail 
To add more dressing, roll for a few random items within the lair by using the Item table (p.163) or 
the Dungeon Dressing tables in the Dungeon Master’s Guide (pp.298-301). 
 
Terrain Features 
Use this table to provide some interesting terrain within the villain’s lair, or within the area of your 
final encounter (or any encounter, really!) Either roll for a random result, or choose a result that fits 
thematically. 
When consulting the notes for each of these terrain features, consider any bonuses or penalties 
carefully, as they will affect the balance of any encounters.  
 
Terrain Features Table for Lairs / Final Encounters 
Here are some examples of features that you could work into your final encounters, or any encounters 
really. Make the feature fit with the theme of your story and soon you will be crafting memorable 
encounters a cut above the average. If none of these interest you, try creating your own features with 
a few keyword rolls.

FEATURE 
NOTES 
01-
04 
Vegetation 
If outdoors, this could be thorny bushes (steer clear of things like 
assassin vines as this increases the encounter difficulty). If in a 
dungeon, it could be some sort of fungi that releases poisonous spores 
when disturbed. The spores could have any number of effects.   
05-
08 
Pools of liquid 
Acid, poison, lava or some other substance that must be avoided. Or, 
that creatures can be pushed into. 
09-
11 
Elevation  
An elevation with terrain, like a plateau, can provide an interesting 
dynamic. It could be a slight elevation stopping one side from entering 
melee with the other (unless they use an action to scale said elevation), 
or perhaps high ground which grants an attack bonus.  
12-
15 
Containers with 
volatile 
substances 
This could be a wizard’s lab where random potion bottles can easily be 
broken, releasing magical effects, or perhaps a storeroom in a castle 
where barrels of gunpowder can ignite if touched by fire. Or anything 
you can think of!

16-
18 
Hissing steam 
pipes 
Perhaps your final battle takes place in a sewer. Every time you are 
beside one of these pipes, roll a d20. On a 19 or 20, the pipe belches 
out steam and you must move to get out of the way or take 1d8 fire 
damage.  
19-
21 
Production line / 
Moving 
mechanisms 
An army of automatons making siege weapons? A creation forge 
churning out warforged warriors? Basically, any encounter that 
happens in the area of a mechanised system of some sort is going to 
have that extra touch of danger. 
There could be all manner of mechanisms in action. Giant mechanical 
pistons, steam vents, turning gears… the whole encounter area could 
be some sort of clockwork factory. Make it fit with the theme of your 
BBEG and work it into the story. 
22-
25 
Suspension 
bridge 
A battle on a swinging bridge could involve dex saves, the chance of 
getting thrown off the bridge…  
26-
29 
Chasm 
There are always chasms and sinkholes underground, very useful for 
hurling bothersome enemies into. However, such strategies can always 
backfire! 
30-
33 
Broken floor 
Smashed cobbles, rickety floorboards and the like can all provide the 
possibility of someone tripping over and becoming prone.  
34-
37 
Quick sand 
Similar to pools of liquid, this is a very dangerous one for outdoor 
encounters. Repeated strength checks required to escape. And while in 
there, any creature is really a sitting duck. 
38-
40 
Boulders / fallen 
masonry 
Simple but effective, a boulder or piece or masonry can provide cover, 
high ground or just restrict you from entering certain areas.  
41-
44 
Magical glyphs / 
glyph traps 
Perhaps some mage has scrawled runes on the wall the trigger fireball 
every time you walk past them.  
45-
47 
Fire 
An area of the terrain is on fire? Could be as the result of a wayward 
fireball, or some other occurrence.  
48-
52 
Collapsing 
shelves 
In a library, perhaps shelves of books are toppling over. In a wizard’s 
lab, perhaps it is shelves of potions. Either way, they will need to be 
dodged!  
53-
56 
Broken glass or 
any sharp, shard-
like material 
Tread carefully or take some piercing damage! 
57-
60 
Slick surface, 
rubble-strewn 
surface, anything 
either slippery or 
movable 
Ball bearings are an easy way to make an area difficult terrain for your 
enemies, but sometimes such hindrances occur naturally. You might 
be fighting on a scree-covered slope, or in a dungeon strewn with 
rubble. Easy to fall over and become prone in such a situation, unless 
you can succeed on a (relatively low DC) dexterity save/check each 
round.  
A muddy hillside is a simple way to implement this idea.  
61-
64 
Noxious stench 
As of a dead animal, or multiple corpses. Alternately, some kind of foul 
vegetation might be emitting a smell. This might require wisdom 
saves, or perhaps an extra save for wizards to maintain concentration. 
65-
67 
Underwater 
Part of the terrain / room is submerged. This could be as a result of 
flooding, an underground river impinging on the area, or perhaps the 
whole structure is half in water - or even fully underwater! 
Perhaps the water is even rising, adding a time pressure element to 
the encounter.

68-
70 
Mirror room 
This provides the opportunity to impose Perception checks on your 
characters and monsters to have them determine where the enemy 
actually is. 
71-
73 
Hostages 
If the enemy has hostages, allies of the PCs, imprisoned somewhere in 
the final encounter area, this can provide an interesting dynamic 
where the PCs have to avoid harming the creatures. The enemies can 
also use these hostages as cover. 
74-
77 
Anti-magic zones 
Parts of the encounter area where magic does not function. The 
difference is, the BBEG recognizes where those areas are while the 
characters do not.  
78-
81 
Wild magic zones Parts of the encounter area that cause any spell to undergo a wild 
magic surge every time a spell is cast.  
82-
85 
Anti-gravity 
zones 
The rules of physics? Gone.  
86-
88 
Volatile minerals 
In the Underdark, there is a mineral known as Redstone which can 
cause certain hits to have extra effect. I.e., critting on a 19 or a 20. You 
could take this concept and extend it - minerals that cause creatures to 
polymorph when they come near, gain banes or boons, or any number 
of things.  
89-
92 
Docks / sewers / 
warehouses 
Any urban area that sees a lot of industrial action is going to have 
crates, sacks, treacherous surfaces, cranes to swing on, and any 
number of other terrain features. 
93-
96 
Fog /smoke / 
steam 
Obscuring vision, interrupting line of sight. 
97-
100 
Moving vehicles 
The various sides of the battle are in carts, or airships, or on flying 
carpets, or any variation of the above. Perception checks required / the 
ability to ram other vehicles to impose disadvantage on attacks… you 
could come up with an interesting set of mechanics for such a 
situation.

Chapter 5-4 
Solo Monster Encounter Tables 
(Levels 16-20) 
 
Introduction 
TSAT1 contains solo-friendly encounter tables to take 
characters up to level 15. The tables in this chapter 
provide encounters from levels 16-20.  
Your solo game will benefit hugely by your learning how 
to create your own encounters using the mechanics given 
on pp.82-83 of Dungeon Master’s Guide. As you will know 
if you have read those pages, parties of small numbers (1-
2) require different calculations than parties of larger 
numbers (3-5). It is recommended that you learn how to 
create balanced encounters for your 1-2 PC party, or that 
you find a reliable online encounter generator that factors 
in these nuances. Of course, if you are soloing with 3 or 
more PCs, then you can find a number of encounter tables, 
both in pdf and online generator form, that will help you 
create monster encounters. The resources in this chapter 
(and Chapter 16 of TSAT 1) are aimed at parties of 1-2 
PCs. 
The monster numbers below are mere suggestions, and 
there will be other CR combinations that fit as well. For 
encounters where all monsters are the same CR, every 
combination up to a maximum number of five monsters 
per encounter is included below (up to CR 14). The 
highest enemy a solo level 20 PC can realistically face is a 
CR 13 monster, which is a deadly encounter. Two level 20 
PCs can potentially tackle a CR 19 monster in a deadly 
encounter. 
The method for generating encounters using the tools in 
this chapter is the same as in TSAT 1.  
 
Method 
1. 
Roll on the appropriate difficulty table for your solo 
PC’s level (if you are using 2 PCs, consult the 
heading 2 PCs, below). 
2. 
Find the result on that table (e.g.: 1 CR 4 + 2 CR 2 
Monsters). Take note of that result. 
3. 
Go to Section Two: Creature Tables by Environment and 
CR. Find the environment that your PC or PCs are 
currently in. 
4. 
Roll on the appropriate CR table(s) that you noted 
down earlier. 
 
2 PCs 
A conversion table for 2 PCs is included after the solo PC 
tables. The 2 PC conversion table in TSAT 1 went from 
level 1-10. The one in this chapter goes from level 11-20. 
The encounter calculators below are for a solo character 
of level 16-20. Within each level, a table for each difficulty 
(easy, medium, hard, deadly) is provided. And, as in the 
first book, the encounters within each table also scale 
upwards in difficulty. Therefore, you are looking to make 
a low roll, if you can! 
 
Monsters by 
Environment 
Following the encounter calculators is a list of monsters 
organized under terrain headings, then sub-grouped by 
CR. This section is called Creature Tables by Environment & 
CR. Using the encounter calculators with the monster 
lists, an endless variety of encounters can be generated.  
For ease of reference, several of the monster tables from 
TSAT1 are included herein, so you’re not having to flick 
between books constantly.  The monster tables go all the 
way up to CR13, which is the highest you will require for 
single PC parties. 
You may have your own monster tables which you wish 
to use, or your own monster resources (such as the 
excellent Monster Manual Expanded Series by Dragonix). 
The way that the encounter tables are structured should 
enable you to easily construct encounters using any 
monsters, simply by referring to their CR. 
Something to consider is that not all monsters contained 
in official resources have a terrain as such. Some appear in 
special circumstances - planar disruptions, magical 
summoning and the like. When coming up with 
interesting encounters for your party, perhaps read 
through monster CR lists and create some interesting 
stories as to why, for example, a chain devil might appear 
in a swamp. That is not its terrain, but as a chain devil 
does not really have an assigned terrain, you are not going 
to encounter it otherwise. Also, it is well worth your while 
reading through the monster lore provided in resources 
like Monster Manual which can give you great ideas about 
encounters and even whole quests for your characters. 
Here and there I have taken a little creative license when 
it comes to where certain monsters are placed. 
Encountering a stone golem or shield guardian 
underwater? Well, constructs don’t need to breathe, and 
either one of those could be guarding an ancient 
underwater ruin. A fire giant in a desert? A clay golem in 
a swamp? These aren’t standard canon locations for these 
creatures, but to me they make sense.  
It is worth noting that the tables in Section One are scaled 
so that higher rolls provide more difficult encounters 
within the tables. So you want to roll low!

2 PC Conversion Table 
  
Using the following table, and the encounter tables that follow, you can create balanced encounters 
for your deadly duo of adventurers! The 2 PC Conversion Table in TSAT1 went up to level 10, this 
deals with levels 11 and above. If you see the direction See table following, refer to the small selection 
of 2-PC tables immediately following this table.  
The final two tables (2 PCs, Level 20, Hard and Deadly) contain results for monsters CR 14 and 
above, tables for which are not included herein. Use your monster resource to find appropriate CR 
monsters for this table.

Playthrough 1: Demonstrating Random Monster 
Combat AI, using oracles in combat and other 
combat-related solo concepts 
 
A couple of days ago I started running Rime of 
the Frostmaiden with my characters Abulu & 
Marble, using the published WOTC resource 
mixed with an oracle and a few of the other 
resources contained herein, as well as some 
other third-party resources. For a more in-
depth look at how this can be done, check out a 
resource like The Dungeon Oracle by myself or 
DM Yourself by Tom Scutt (available on DM’s 
Guild and Drivethrurpg, respectively). 
In this playthrough, I am going to take a little 
diversion from the first quest of ROTF and run 
a little freeform side quest with my two current 
favourite characters! So as not to upset the 
balance of levels (I’m progressing using the 
recommended levels in ROTF, converted using 
the solo conversion table given on p.3 of The 
Dungeon Oracle) I will not be progressing my 
characters’ levels or in any way adjusting the 
balance during this side quest. It is purely for 
fun.  
 
MILD SPOILER: The adventure will end up 
being a kind of mass combat decided with 
oracle rolls and skill checks. It is designed to 
demonstrate just how versatile solo play can be. 
 
NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN ICEWIND 
DALE 
So, first up, what is my Icewind Dale side 
quest? I’ve got a few options here, as listed in 
the Chapter 1-8: How Do I…? The one I think 
I’m going to go with is rolling on a random 
encounter table and using that as a starting 
point for a quest. Marble and Abulu are 
currently within the town of Bremen in 
Icewind Dale, having just defeated a powerful 
undead assassin named Sephek Kaltro, one of 
the beginning quests in the book. So, I’m going 
to roll on the Urban Encounters Table (Chapter 
3-2 of TSAT2). There is a similar table in 
TSAT1 as well, which could provide other 
quest possibilities, as well as dungeon and 
wilderness encounters. Or, these can function 
as simple encounters that your characters come 
across during a larger quest. Let’s roll.  
 
d100=03: A guard patrol suddenly runs past you. 
“To the gates, to the gates!” they are yelling. “We 
are being attacked!” 
 
Oh nice. Straight into it, and this provides a 
great opportunity for my characters to gain a 
bit of renown in Bremen, which can help with 
future quests without disrupting the balance too 
much. Since the guards yelled “We are being 
attacked,” that means the attack is already in 
progress. But what sort of attacker are we 
dealing with here? For the purpose of 
determining a random monster type, you can 
use the Random Monster Type Table given in 
Chapter 5-1 of this book.  
d100=50: fey. 
Ok, cool. What I’m going to do now is look at 
the monster section in Rime of the Frostmaiden 
to see if there are any interesting fey monsters 
that I could use here. A quick look shows me 
there are no fey in that resource, so I consult a 
monster list, cross-referencing the fey monster 
type with an arctic environment. Now all I get 
is a bheur hag and a winter eladrin. These are too 
powerful for my 2 level 3 PCs and their 
sidekick, and I’m envisioning this encounter 
involving a decent number of monsters, like a 
small invasion or raid. So, considering all that, 
let’s re-roll on that random monster table. This 
is something I do often. If a particular result 
doesn’t fit, re-roll. 
d100=74: monstrosity.  
Reviewing various resources reveals that this 
result doesn’t fit either, so I’m just going to 
start reading through the monster section to 
find something that fits. Reading a resource like 
Monster Manual, Volo’s Guide to Monsters, 
Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes or, in this case, the 
monster section of an adventure resource like 
Rime of the Frostmaiden will provide you with

rich material for solo adventuring. Monster 
lore is a boon for solo players. Quite often just 
reading through monster descriptions can 
inspire you with a whole solo quest, as I’ll 
attempt to show you herein. 
Flicking through the monster section of ROTF, 
I find the Icewind Kobold and Icewind Kobold 
Zombie. They look pretty suitable! Let’s allow a 
dice roll to decide which we are going to use. 
d6, halved.  
d6=3: Icewind Kobold. (p.296) 
Now, let’s decide on a number of NPCs. The 
subheading Bremen in a Nutshell on p.25 of Rime 
of the Frostmaiden says that “Bremen can muster 
up to 25 soldiers (use the tribal warrior stat 
block) and 2 veterans.”  
The idea here is to allow your available 
resources to determine as much of the material 
in your quest as possible. You want to feel like 
forces beyond your control are generating the 
game, so that the quest feels properly random 
and unpredictable. 
We’ll go with a random roll like d12+6 tribal 
warriors with a 50% chance of a veteran.  
d12+6=11 tribal warriors.  
Veteran present? d100=02: yes. (I went with a 
60% likelihood).  
11 tribal warriors and 1 veteran. Let’s get those 
statblocks. I use the Inkwell Ideas 5e Creature 
Decks: Nonplayer Characters cards as they allow 
me to access statblocks without too much 
difficulty, and they also maximise tabletop 
space.  
This is looking like it’s going to be an all-out 
slogfest, but afterwards we will need to 
understand why these kobolds attacked, which 
could lead to a larger quest! 
Let’s calculate the battle numbers. I want it to 
be on the deadly side of hard. 15 Icewind 
Kobolds is still an easy encounter, so let’s add 
something a bit higher level. A quick bit of 
calculation (it’s a good idea for solo players to 
get a bit conversant with balance mechanics so 
they can quickly generate all sorts of random 
encounters) reveals that a CR 4 monster will 
put this encounter at just the right level. 
Reading through ROTF, I find that the verbeeg 
marauder (a kind of ice-dwelling giant) is a good 
choice. And it has somehow enlisted these 
kobolds… this is good quest material!  
Regarding verbeeg, the monster lore reads:  
 
It’s not unusual to find a gang of hill giants and 
ogres led by a verbeeg, since verbeeg are much 
smarter than their brutish cousins. Verbeeg also 
enjoy the company of mammalian bests and allow 
bears, wolves, worgs and other predators to lair with 
them. They catch and keep horses, mules, sheep, goats 
and cattle for food and trade.  
 
OK, so maybe we’ll take out a few kobolds and 
add a worg or two to the mix! 
12 x icewind kobolds, 2 x worgs and 1 
verbeeg marauder puts the XP threshold ats 
4800, exactly on deadly! Perfect. Now we have 
a balanced encounter with some nice story to 
go along with it. This is a raiding party, 
looking to loot livestock from Bremen, but 
perhaps there is a more powerful coalition of 
giants, humanoids and beasts behind it. Perhaps 
this is just a reconnaissance mission. What I 
think I have here is the beginnings of a 
perfectly-themed Icewind Dale quest.  
Let’s place these two forces a bit of a distance 
apart so we can make use of the Random 
Monster AI Table in Chapter 5-1. This is a table 
that randomises monster actions. For this quest 
I’m using the VTT Roll20 to keep track of 
everything. So, the first thing I’m going to do 
is create stat blocks and tokens to represent the 
icewind kobold and verbeeg marauder, since I 
don’t already have those set up (the worg is 
already there with my Monster Manual purchase 
through Roll20, which provides me with all the 
stat blocks from that resource in movable token 
form). I also quickly make an ice village 
battlemap, just a basic sketch in Roll20. I throw 
in a few huts and some rocks and trees. 
 
Marble glances at Abulu and Wren (sidekick) and 
they turn and run behind the twelve or so guards, 
towards the walled defences of Bremen. A 
powerfully-built older warrior runs at the head, 
directing the guards into formation. Then the enemy 
comes into sight… a guerrilla force of about a dozen 
kobolds, two of them riding worgs, and a gangly-
looking giant of some sort. It looks a bit like a hill 
giant, but has a look of malicious intelligence… they 
are stationed around the pens and are helping 
themselves to sheep, goats, and other livestock! If 
their raid is successful, it could prove disastrous for 
this town that will need these livestock to get them 
through the endless winter brought on by the 
Frostmaiden Auril! 
“Stand fast, men!” the hardy leader hisses, glancing 
back. As he does so, he just happens to catch sight of 
Abulu, Marble and Wren, and gives a terse nod in 
recognition of their joining the fray. Having an 
eight-foot-tall bugbear on your side must surely be 
some comfort, especially against a giant… a

murmur spreads through the Bremen warriors as 
they all note the arrival of the trio… 
 
Now, I set about running a massive combat, 
featuring thirty separate combatants. I briefly 
considered using a mass combat resource like 
the Unearthed Arcana Mass Combat rules, but I 
am not in the mood to learn a new ruleset just 
now! I make a note to myself to do that in the 
future, however. I will use the Random 
Monster AI, though. I may even use it for the 
tribal warriors and the veteran.   
On rolling initiative, I see that the tribal 
warriors are the first to act! So, what has their 
commander commanded them to do? Well, 
nothing yet, as it’s not the commander’s turn. 
They are holding for now, and perhaps trying 
to gain some sort of stealth advantage.  
 
Oracle: Has the commander told them to 
approach stealthily? No, but… Wren is trying 
to persuade him to do so.  
Contested check: Wren Persuasion vs Veteran’s 
Wisdom (DC 11). I suppose you could use 
Charisma as well. 
Wren Persuasion d20+5=14. Successful.  
 
The veteran waves his men on with his sword. 
“Come on, let’s take them head on!” 
“Wait!” Wren hisses. “Stealth would provide us 
with a great advantage here! Let’s hit these brutes 
hard before they can even see us!” 
The veteran clenches his jaw, then gestures tersely 
around his men. “They have one spear each, missy!” 
he whispers urgently. “What would you have me 
do?” 
Wren looks around quickly for something, anything, 
which could be used instead of a spear to perform a 
ranged attack.  
 
Oracle: Can Wren see anything that could be 
used for a ranged attack by the tribal warriors? 
d20=5: No.  
OK, strategy. Examining the battlemap, I see 
that one house over is a kind of bottleneck 
where two houses are adjacent, about 20 ft 
apart. If the warriors could lure the kobolds 
and worgs into that bottleneck, then Abulu, 
Marble and Wren could attack from the rear, 
trapping them in between two forces.  
 
“All right,” Wren says, crouching down, and 
bidding the veteran do the same. “Then we must be 
smart about this.” 
Quickly Wren explains her plan. “But make no 
mistake, chief,” she adds, glancing around the 
warriors of Bremen. “Some of us will lose our lives 
today.” 
 
OK, so what I need here is first of all a Stealth 
roll from the tribal warriors, to see if they can 
retreat slightly and insert themselves between 
those two houses (they are kind of just in sight 
of the creatures). The DC will be the highest 
passive Perception among the enemies. The 
worg has this, with a passive Perception of 14. 
But they have advantage on smell-based 
Perception checks. Oracle time.  
Oracle: Are the worgs on the alert for threats 
(+3 likely). d20+3=12: Yes, but… there are 
also tasty sheep on offer! 
Wisdom check, DC 10. We’re getting quite 
convoluted here, but I’m going to play it out. 
Can they overcome the sheepish temptations 
and stay on guard vigilantly? 
Worg Wisdom check. d20+0=5: No. They are 
not currently watching actively for movement. 
 
Let’s make one Stealth roll for the whole crew 
to see if they are noticed, DC 14 (Worg passive 
Perception). 
d20+0=9! The veteran also only rolls an 11 (+1 
Dex modifier), so no, despite the worgs being 
distracted, they still notice the clumsy tribal 
Bremen warriors trying to retreat from their 
hasty forward position! 
Ok, now we have some circumstance for our 
battle, some suggested tactics. So far, I’ve 
basically rolled initiatives and used a 
combination of oracle rolls and skill checks to 
determine a whole bunch of exciting 
circumstances.  
 
“Fall back!” the veteran warrior yells. “On me, 
quickly! Yosrick, move to the left, between Ghudvil 
and Yantra’s houses!” 
Hearing their commanders call, the warriors, sniffed 
out by the worgs who in turn alert the kobolds and 
their giant chief, quickly retreat between two low 
houses. 
 
Dash movement by the tribal warriors. Also, 
I’m going to make a Stealth check by each of 
my characters, two of whom are in cover. 
Marble, as usual, is being a clumsy automaton! 
Stealth check Abulu: passes easily.  
Stealth check Wren: passes easily! 
Stealth check Marble (the tension): passes vs 
kobolds and verbeeg, but not the worgs… who

obviously hear him (as Marble doesn’t really 
have a smell, being a warforged) ... 
 
So, the worgs might make for Marble. Possibly. 
That could work out ok, perhaps… or it could 
go horribly, horribly wrong! 
 
Wren takes her turn next, takes cunning action 
to dash, then fires her hand crossbow at a 
kobold. It misses.  
 
Icewind kobolds are up next! I am going to use 
the Random Monster AI Table to determine 
what they do. There are no Menace Points so 
far. 
 
d100=96: SURRENDER (if humanoid and at 
less than 20% max HP) or TAKE COVER & 
ATTACK or (if no ranged attacks) ATTACK. 
 
They will take cover and make ranged attacks. 
Well, the kobolds have daggers and javelins, 
which have a pretty limited range, so they may 
not even be able to do that. I guess they will 
just try and get as close as they can to make 
ranged attacks. A javelin has a range of 30 ft., 
so they’ll try and get that close. There may not 
even be a single attack in the first round of 
combat.  
I could also go with the Surrender result, but 
they are not at less than 20% max hp, and I’m 
just going to decide… these guys are hungry 
from some fresh meat! They are desperate to 
get this livestock, and don’t mind if a few 
villagers die along the way.  
 
“Steady!” one of the lead warriors’ yells, as a horde 
of kobolds comes scampering across the snow-covered 
ground. “STEADY!” 
 
The kobolds all dash. Now the Verbeeg! 
Random Monster AI Table.  
d100=85: FLEE (if Menace Points 30+ then 
Dash, incurring AOO) or USE DEFENSIVE 
FEATURE (e.g., healing, invisibility) or 
MAKE RANGED ATTACK or HOLD 
ACTION. 
These monsters are turning out to be pretty 
cautious! There are no Menace Points so far, so 
let’s look at the giant’s stat block to see what 
defensive features he has? Nope, none. He is 
just a straight-up big brute.  
OK, ranged attack? Nope, none, so he will hold 
action for now.  
Next, worgs.  
d100=35: MOVE & ATTACK nearest enemy 
using most powerful method, or ATTACK. 
 
The worgs will move on the tribal warriors, 
since they are closest.  
 
Two huge worgs come galloping, mouths gnashing, 
towards the warriors. “HOLD YOUR 
GROUND!” the same warrior yells, although he 
himself is struggling to master his courage.  
 
Both Worgs move to their full allowance, to 
get into melee range with the tribal warriors, 
but they don’t have enough movement to get 
there and attack.  
OK, Marble’s turn! First up, he enters rage as a 
bonus action, then attacks with greatsword. 
 
Then, emerging from around the side of the 
building, Marble runs up on a worg, brandishing 
his greatsword and yelling like some sort of metallic 
barbarian! But his attack goes wide, missing the 
rapidly advancing worg. 
 
Abulu is going to come out and target some 
spike growth on the verbeeg and a couple of 
kobolds. This should buy us some valuable time 
while doing some decent damage. The verbeeg 
is in the midst of it. We’ll have to use oracle 
rolls to determine whether he moves or not! 
 
Abulu steps forward, and, calling forth the forces of 
nature present under the snow, summons a tangle of 
vines and thorns, engulfing the giant, who looks 
around bewildered as this mass of foliage appears… 
 
Now it’s the veteran’s turn. Well, he will dash 
up with his men, while the party will attack 
from the side. I move all the relevant tokens on 
the map. 
Back to the top of the round, the tribal 
warriors, who will attack the worgs they are in 
melee with.  
 
The captain of the Bremen guard bolts away from 
the characters and into the bottleneck provided by the 
two houses. “Forward men!” he yells. “For 
Bremen!” 
Yelling at the top of their lungs, and mustered by the 
courage of their hardy chief, the warriors surge 
forward bravely towards the gnashing monsters! 
The forward warriors attack the second worg and 
immediately enter a pitched battle, struggling to hit 
the thing. The rear warriors, on the other hand, 
attack the first worg who is already amongst the

houses, and gravely wound it within seconds. This 
battle is fever-pitched! The press of warriors is so 
tight that the last two warriors who move in are 
forced to throw spears instead of wielding them 
hand to hand! One hits, the other throws his spear 
wide. It seems reckless, to throw away your only 
weapon. The worgs do seem to be going down quick, 
after all. But their chief is not so impressed. 
“Hold on to your weapons, you fools!” the veteran 
scolds as he wades forward, longsword in hand… 
 
Wren’s turn, and she targets a kobold who is 
attacking a tribal warrior… and misses again! 
Come on Wren! 
OK, kobold turn. Random Monster AI. Let’s 
see, Menace Points are at 15 currently.  
 
d100+ Menace Points = 88. They will make 
ranged attacks with daggers or javelins [d6] 
(1-4) Dagger (5-6) Javelin. Most of them have 
multiple targets, so I’ll decide target with dice 
rolls also. 
The kobolds do pretty well, wounding a few 
warriors! We’ll need to do away with them 
quick if we’re going to win this! 
 
The scurrying kobolds fling daggers and javelins at 
the tribal warriors, and a few at Marble as well! A 
few are wounded, one warrior particularly badly 
with a dagger to his chest, but they fight on bravely.  
 
Kobolds done, now the verbeeg marauder, who 
is trapped in the middle of spike growth. He 
might not move due to this, but then… if he 
doesn’t back up his forces, they have no hope. 
What is the smartest course of action right now 
for the verbeeg? Probably to back up his forces. 
I’m going to make an Intelligence check for the 
verbeeg.  
d20+0=8.  
 
I determine then from this skill check, that it is 
unlikely the verbeeg will follow the most 
intelligent course of action (back up his 
troops).  
Oracle: does the verbeeg follow the most 
intelligent course of action? (unlikely -3). 
d20-3=2: No, and... he’ll yell at his forces to 
retreat and defend him. Cowardly verbeeg! 
Surrounded as he is by spike growth, the verbeeg 
will stay where he is, perhaps thinking the spell 
might fade away… if someone comes near, he 
will engage, but he’s not willingly going to 
wound himself… that’s his reasoning anyway.  
 
The verbeeg, frustrated, roars at the spikes and 
tangled growths in his way, trying to pick a way 
through but not really being able to move. 
Meanwhile, his worgs and kobolds are being 
slaughtered! He bellows at the kobolds to come to his 
defence. 
 
Verbeeg holds action, as per the skill check and 
oracle roll above.  
Worg turn. I’m just going to have them attack. 
They’re savage beasts, maybe they’ll be able to 
savage a few of these warriors and die a 
glorious death. One worg kills a warrior 
outright on its first attack. I make all the rolls 
for both of them.  
 
One worgs grabs a warrior in its gnashing jaws 
and mauls him to death. The other snaps at Marble, 
rending a couple of plates in the barbarian’s armour, 
but not pushing him back or otherwise slowing him 
down. “Come at me, you beast!” the warforged 
shrills in a metallic voice, undaunted.  
 
Marble’s turn. He’s going to use reckless attack.  
 
Marble strides forward without any thought for his 
own safety, but his greatsword is true: cleaving 
through the worg’s hide, opening up a garish scarlet 
wound in its side.  
 
Abulu! He’ll cast thunderwave.  
 
The bugbear druid strides up and blasts two kobolds 
with a powerful thunderwave spell, crippling one 
with the spell and killing one outright.  
 
I add the appropriate menace points for these 
attacks. 
Veteran! Ranged attack on the worg with 
crossbow. You obviously make character and 
allied NPC actions as you see fit. The AI 
controls the monsters (although you can have 
the AI control NPCs too, if you want to make 
things really hard on yourself!) 
 
Striding purposefully forward, the veteran draws 
his heavy crossbow with both hands and loads it. 
Seeing his men set upon by the worgs, he levels the 
crossbow with steely resolve, aims, and looses the 
bolt, dropping the beast with a single shot to its 
temple. The men are at first stunned silent, then turn 
and roar their approval at their chief.  
“Save your cheers for afterward!” their commander 
yells, although there is a hint of victory in his 
expression. “The battle is not done yet!”

Tribal warriors. They move forward to poke 
the worgs to death with their spears.  
 
The other worg is quickly done away with and then 
the warriors, emboldened, move in on the kobolds… 
A few are wounded. The warrior who earlier threw 
his spear takes a moment to pause over his fallen 
comrade, closing his eyes for a moment of prayer as 
he does so.  
“No time for that either, Shulbeg!” his commander 
yells, still wielding his crossbow as he moves quickly 
forward.  
 
Menace Points are at 33! 
Wren’s turn. She draws rapier and moves in on 
the kobolds, using her cunning action to dash 
so she can get into a flanking position with a 
tribal warrior. This incurs AOO from two 
kobolds, both of which miss. 
 
The warrior’s eyes go wide as he sees the diminutive 
girl blink into vision like a mage’s illusion behind 
the kobold he is facing off with, as if from nowhere. 
Quickly she skewers two kobolds in succession, 
dropping the first one and all but killing the second. 
The kobolds shriek in alarm as this lightning flash 
of an assassin appears in their midst.  
 
Menace Points 39.  Kobold turn. The verbeeg 
commanded them to retreat and defend him, are 
they going to do that? I make a Charisma check 
for the verbeeg vs the kobold’s Wisdom, which 
it fails! OK, let’s roll on the Monster AI table. 
d100+Menace Points = 71: USE MOST 
POWERFUL FEATURE or TAKE COVER & 
MAKE RANGED ATTACK (if they can do so 
without incurring AOO) or ATTACK  
 
OK, I’m going to interpret this that they start 
to move back toward the verbeeg, making a 
ranged attack and ending their turn behind 
cover if possible (there are trees and boulders 
on the battlemap). There is one, however, who 
can’t do it without incurring AOO, so he won’t 
move, but will attack. Dice rolls determine that 
all of them but one fling their javelins as ranged 
attacks. And all of them miss, except for dagger 
guy who crits on a tribal warrior!  
In a desperate bid, the kobolds flee back towards 
their giant commander, still stuck amongst the 
thorns, flinging their javelins as they go; all bar one, 
who deftly aims a dagger at one of the Bremen 
warriors, catching him in the midriff. The warrior 
rips the blade out with a cry of pain, grits his teeth 
and presses forward. 
 
OK, now the verbeeg, and at this stage I’m 
wondering, does the verbeeg realize where this 
magic is coming from? I’m going to have him 
make an Intelligence check with the DC being 
Marble’s Wisdom (his spellcasting ability 
score). DC is 15. 
The verbeeg crits the check! 
Oracle: Realizing what’s going on now, will the 
verbeeg move through the spike growth? 
d20=5: No.  
 
All of sudden, the verbeeg’s gaze settles on Abulu, 
who is motioning with his hands, causing the vines 
and creepers to twist and imprison him within the 
tangle of harsh foliage. It points a huge hand, 
directing the kobolds’ gaze towards Abulu.   
“The mage!” bellows the brute. “Kill the mage!” 
 
These guys are running out of options. I mean, 
I could roll on the Random Monster AI table 
for the verbeeg, but I prefer to let the oracle 
decide it. The verbeeg is smarter than your 
average hill giant, so he’s not going to hurt 
himself if he can get some minion to do it 
instead. And perhaps, once free of the spell, 
he’ll simply try to escape. 
Marble’s turn.  
 
Striding across the icy terrain, Marble draws a 
handaxe from his belt and targets a fleeing kobold. 
But the spinning projectile misses and disappears 
into a snow drift with a puff. 
 
Abulu’s turn.  
 
Hearing the giant’s command, Abulu steps back a 
few paces, getting himself beyond the range of the 
kobold’s attacks… but not before whispering a few 
healing words over a grievously wounded Bremen 
warrior.  
 
The veteran. 
 
Moving quickly forward amongst his men, the elder 
commander of the Bremen militia rallies his men 
with a cry of “take the fight to them, lads!” and 
levels his crossbow at a kobold. Once more, he is a 
dead shot and catches a kobold right in the neck, 
killing the creature instantly, to more shouts of 
approval from his men. This modest leader of a 
village militia is impressive, and Abulu and Marble 
wonder what battle experience he has already had.

Menace Points are 45. Now the tribal warriors 
will go.  
Cutting down a couple of kobolds as they go, the 
tribal warriors press forward towards the verbeeg, 
emboldened by their victory and by their valorous 
companions. The tide of battle has turned their way, 
and the kobolds and their verbeeg master are all but 
routed.  
 
Menace Points are at 57. Wren moves in. 
 
Striding forward, Wren walks directly up to a 
kobold, and with two swift rapier strikes dispatches 
the wretched creature. 
 
Menace Points 66. This battle is all but won. 
Only four kobolds and the verbeeg remain. 
Two of those kobolds are with the verbeeg, 
within the circle. They are not moving, staying 
with the verbeeg and trapped by spike growth. 
Icewind kobolds, Random Monster AI roll.  
d100+Menace Points = 77: USE MOST 
POWERFUL FEATURE or TAKE COVER & 
MAKE RANGED ATTACK (if they can do so 
without incurring AOO) or ATTACK. 
 
In a last-ditch effort, two kobolds throw daggers at 
Marble, only one of which finds its mark, but barely 
makes a scratch on the metal barbarian’s tough skin. 
  
Now the verbeeg marauder. What will it do? 
Oracle: Does the verbeeg move out of the spike 
growth, now that the battle is all but lost? 
d20=16: Yes.  
OK, now I’m going to use the AI to determine 
his next move.  
d100+Menace Points = 92: FLEE (if Menace 
Points 30+ then Dash, incurring AOO) or USE 
DEFENSIVE FEATURE (e.g., healing, 
invisibility) or MAKE RANGED ATTACK or 
HOLD ACTION. 
 
The verbeeg, knowing that the battle is lost, turns 
tail and flees, pushing through the spike growth to 
the south, away from the warriors, the veteran and 
our heroes, back towards the wilderness it came 
from… roaring with pain, it powers through the 
spiky foliage which rips its skin, wounding it until it 
is a bloody mess. Wren and the veteran fire after it 
with their bows, but its long gait soon puts it beyond 
reach. The last of the kobolds are slaughtered trying 
to flee through the spiky growth, or quickly cut down 
by the Bremen warriors.  
 
The verbeeg takes 8d4 damage from spike 
growth! The rolls equal 20 hp, which leaves it 
with plenty of juice to flee. And it does flee.  
 
The battle is won! Coming up to the heroes, the 
veteran, who introduces himself as Brenton Garre, 
shakes hands firmly with each in turn. “We shall 
raise mead together tonight!” he enthuses. 
“Indeed, we shall,” Abulu says, gripping Brenton’s 
hand firmly in a huge, furry paw. “But I fear that 
the verbeeg will be back, with even more kobolds... 
and maybe a few other giants as well. You need to 
fortify your defences.” 
Brenton’s eyes go dark at this. And then he looks 
back, to the place where one of his warriors fell, 
mauled to death by a worg.  
“They shall pay,” he growls darkly. “For every drop 
of Bremen blood spilt here today, they shall pay 
dearly!” 
“We must take the fight to them,” Marble states 
simply. “That is the only way your village has any 
hope of surviving.” 
“He’s right,” Wren adds. “This was just the 
beginning.” 
 
This is one of the more fun and interesting solo 
combats I’ve run lately! The mix of oracle, 
random AI and other resources created an 
engaging and story-rich combat encounter. 
And there is room left for more questing 
afterwards… maybe a cavern delve or 
something similar, infiltrating the giant’s lair. 
This was supposed to be a deadly encounter, 
but spike growth nerfed the verbeeg. Some 
interesting turns there.  
I hope this has given you some ideas about how 
to run your own solo combat encounters.

Playthrough 2: Demonstrating the 6d12 system, 
Random Cavern Generator  
and general freeform adventuring 
 
After the raid by the kobolds and the verbeeg 
on Bremen’s livestock, Abulu and Marble 
convince the town guard that they must search 
out the encampment where the verbeeg came 
from. 
Brenton Garre, the head of the militia who has 
lived in Bremen all his life, agrees.  
“Verbeeg make their lairs with all kinds of 
creatures. That one that escaped us could have 
a whole army up there. And I wouldn’t be 
surprised if they’re plotting the next raid as we 
speak!” 
So, together with five warriors from Bremen’s 
militia, and Brenton Garre, our heroes set out 
in search of the giant encampment. Well, the 
next day, after a long rest of course. 
Oracle: did it snow overnight?  d20=7: No.  
So, the verbeeg left a trail. The lads set out, on 
the trail of the verbeeg, whose large footprints, 
along with blood spatter, show them the way 
the giant fled. 
 
OK… at this stage, I’m wondering how far it 
might be to the giant encampment. Certainly, 
far enough that it hasn’t been detected up until 
now. I think d4+2 miles might be a good 
number.  
d4+2=6 miles. 
We’ll calculate this on a mile-by-mile basis, 
simply using the TSAT1 Wilderness Generator 
(Chapter 9 of TSAT1) to create terrain, and the 
6d12 system (Chapter 1-3) to generate 
adventure elements. When we get to the giant 
hideout, I’ll use the Natural Cavern Generator 
(Chapter 2-2) to generate detail.  
 
MILE 1 
They set out across the snowy terrain. What do 
they come across on their first mile of travel? 
I’m using the TSAT1: Overarching Terrain: 
Arctic table to generate terrain. (TSAT1, p.59). 
Wilderness generator d100=22: Continuing 
arctic terrain. 
First 6d12 roll. The “Colour Examples” listed 
on the first table of Chapter 1-3 are the colours 
I actually use for the 6d12 system. I’m rolling 
in the Standard Wilderness column. 
On my first roll, the only die to trigger is the 
multicolour one, and this results in a 12, which 
generates a skill challenge! 
Time to roll on the Skill Challenge table 
(Chapter 3-4). 
 
d100=8: You come across a historical account of the 
happenings here, either a mural or markings etched 
on rock. Make a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. 
If you are successful, you have advantage on all 
Intelligence and Wisdom-based checks for the 
remainder of this quest 
 
Who has the best History roll? I’m also going 
to say that Brenton Garre assists in this check. 
Abulu has a +1 History roll, so we’ll go with 
him. 
d20+1=6 (with advantage!): Fail. 
 
The party comes across some markings, murals and 
the like, etched into the rock. But unfortunately, their 
meaning is obscure.  
“They’re a mystery, these markings,” Brenton says. 
“Been here for years, no-one really knows what 
they’re about. Should probably get a mage to look at 
them some time.” 
They put their heads down and trudge on, following 
the trail left by the verbeeg.  
 
MILE 2 
OK, they continue across the plain… 
Wilderness generator d100=67: Small mountain 
range / foothills.  
Ok, this takes me to the minor feature table 
Small mountain range / foothills. Another d100 
roll.  
d100=77:  Small mountain range, rugged and 
dangerous, partially wooded. Giant eagles and 
the like. 50% hard encounter.  
OK, we might be going into combat now. A 
d100 roll of 50 or below will produce an 
encounter… 
d100=91: No encounter. Whew! 
6d12 roll for this area. I make the roll, and the 
only d12 that triggers is the blue one, which is 
the one that triggers clues!  
To generate clues, you could use keywords, or 
you could roll on a clues table. There is a 
dungeon clues table and a wilderness clues 
table included in TSAT1 (p.52 and p.77 
respectively). I’m going to roll on the

---

## Page 269

269 
 
wilderness clues table now and see what that 
turns up.  
 
Entering a range of small foothills, the party keeps 
an eye out for creatures. Huge eagles circle overhead, 
and everyone is on guard. “There are some 
dangerous beasts around here,” Brenton mutters. 
“What to speak of avalanches as well… go carefully, 
friends…” 
Then, on the snow, Marble spots something, and 
stoops to pick it up.  
“What have you got there?” Abulu asks, coming 
near.  
“A dagger of some kind,” Marble replies. They 
spend a few minutes inspecting the weapon. It has a 
retracting blade and is finely crafted.  
“Hmmm…” Wren mused. “Who dropped this, and 
why?” 
 
A common question regarding solo adventures 
is “How do you deal with the revelation of 
knowledge during the adventure?” 
The idea with generating clues in a freeform 
solo adventure is that you let the clues 
determine the story as you discover them. I just 
found a dagger with a retracting blade… who 
could this fine weapon belong to? Someone else 
who was hunting the giants? Someone who was 
captured by them? We shall find out! 
 
MILE 3 
The party presses on…  
TSAT1: Overarching Terrain: Arctic table. 
d100=40: Continuing arctic terrain. 
Ok, so they are still within the foothills. 6d12 
roll. Again, only one d12 triggers, and it is the 
green one: environment features.  
Let’s roll on the Wilderness Features table 
(Chapter 1-3 of this book).  
d100=29: Haunts. Ooh, interesting! This 
particular result only has one book that 
provides details, the GM’s Miscellany: Wilderness 
Dressing book (from Raging Swan Press, 
available on Drivethrurpg). If you didn’t 
possess that resource, you would simply 
generate details using oracle and keywords. 
Let’s roll on the Haunts table from that 
resource. There are just six of them listed, so 
I’m going to roll a d6. 
  
d6=5: THE PIT (CR 7 XP 3 , 200) The ground 
suddenly opens into a yawning bone strewn pit, 
hundreds of skeletal arms thrusting from its walls. 
Awesome! So, these mountains are haunted… 
Let’s use the Trap table (Chapter 1-4) to 
determine a DC, and then we can make a few 
Dexterity saves… Under the Save DC column I 
roll an 86 on a d100, which sets the DC at 18! 
That’s tough.  
 
Abulu fails, so he’s in the pit… Marble fails too. 
And Wren as well! All three of our heroes are 
in there.  
Save for the tribal warriors, fail, and Brenton 
fails as well! Everyone’s in the pit... 
 
Suddenly, the ground beneath our heroes’ feet gives 
way, and a hideous, gaping pit appears, with skeletal 
arms reaching out towards the middle where its new 
victims are.  
“Quickly, we must get out!” Brenton yells above the 
confusion. The men are panicked and are 
clambering over each other.  
“Calm yourself,” Abulu says, rubbing his shoulder. 
“We are fine.” But glancing around, he sees that 
many have taken injuries from the unexpected fall. 
The soldiers swat the hideous, clawing arms away 
and get themselves clear of the pit.  
 
OK, I’m going to have everyone take 1d6 fall 
damage. 
 
Let’s move on.  
 
MILE 4 
TSAT1: Overarching Terrain: Arctic table. 
d100=15: Continuing arctic terrain. 
6d12 roll. Again, only the d6 triggers. 
Wilderness Feature table (Chapter 1-3). 
d100=36: Cave. Let’s use the GM’s Miscellany 
Wilderness Dressing resource again.  
d100=27: Concealed by three twisted pines an 
earthy hollow opens among the trees’ roots. 
 
Climbing higher into the foothills, they enter a small 
forest. They are quietly wending their way through 
the trees when one of the Bremen warriors makes a 
sound. “Over here, look!” 
Everyone comes to where the warrior is crouched, at 
the base of a stand of twisted pine trees. There, 
concealed by the roots which almost form a kind of 
barred gate, the entrance to a cave. Is this the giant’s 
hideout? 
  
Even though we’re only at mile 4 (and I 
determined that it would be six miles to the 
giant hideout, even though the characters don’t 
know that), I still really like the flavour of this 
cave concealed among tree roots. Let’s have the

---

## Page 270

270 
 
three characters explore it and see if it really is 
connected to the verbeeg and his allies.  
We’ll move to the Natural Cavern Generator 
now and see how things pan out! 
 
First, we roll on the Starting Area table.  
d6=2: A sinkhole leads down to a Cavern. 
Descend, then go to Cavern table. 
I roll a 20 on that, which gives me a large 
irregular cavern. A roll on the Exits table gives 
me two exits from this cavern. The unexplored 
one leads to another cavern. Now I need to roll 
three times on the Features table in this chapter. 
 
d100=32: Some sort of natural shrine / monument. 
Underground temple, using crystals / obelisks / 
other naturally-formed phenomena, but also 
partially worked to enhance the effect. To a God? 
Or perhaps a natural force. Who made it? DC 15 
History check to discern. Use keywords, oracles to 
generate detail.  
 
Keywords: fluttering, costume, portal, 
fragmented. 
 
d100=90: This cavern is flooded. It will be difficult 
to traverse. Either climb around walls, or chance 
swimming across. 25% combat encounter.  
 
d100=100: Cave-in. Ceiling of this cavern partially 
destroyed. 
 
They lower themselves down into a partially caved-
in, flooded cavern. In the centre, however, is what 
appears to be a shrine of some sort… A natural rock 
formation has been fashioned into an altar, with an 
alcove in which an idol is placed. The idol has been 
dressed in a costume of some kind, a robe, and a 
breeze which comes from beyond this cavern is 
causing nearby candles to flutter… There is a 
shimmering light too, like a portal, the fragmented 
light dancing on the walls and ceiling of this strange 
cavern.  
 
25% combat encounter eh? Let’s roll it.  
d100=26! Just scraped by… Let’s make a 6d12 
roll (which could also trigger an encounter). 
We’re now rolling on the Standard Room 
column of the 6d12 table. This time a few more 
things are generated. We have a clue, and a 
skill challenge. Let’s roll on the Clues table 
from TSAT1 (Chapter 8). 
Clue table: A map of a labyrinth neatly made on a 
piece of parchment. 
Skill challenge table: A holy (or unholy) symbol is 
marked on the wall in blood. Make a DC 14 
Intelligence (Religion) check to see if you can 
determine what deity this symbol represents. If 
successful, decide what the deity is based on the 
current quest context, or devise a dice roll to come up 
with a random god. Regardless of success, this god 
will now form one of the threads of your solo 
adventure. The next time you make any d20 roll for 
monsters (attack roll, saving throw, ability check), do 
so with advantage.  
 
Marble comes near to the shrine, and tries to see if he 
can discern what god this is… Brenton Garre joins 
him. There are markings in blood around the base of 
the shrine too, what appear to be holy symbols. 
“Do you know the nature of this deity?” Marble asks 
quietly.  
Brenton shakes his head. “I know our gods… but 
not this…” 
“Someone’s marked in blood here,” Wren says. 
“Worshippers were here at some stage…” 
“I wonder if it was them who dropped the dagger,” 
Marble poses. 
 
OK, so threads. This is a concept in Mythic, 
and is very useful for creating a narrative that 
runs throughout your adventure. We’ll start a 
threads list. In Mythic, threads are triggered 
through the Events Focus table, but here we 
will just form the list, and use it to refer back to 
when we have oracle questions and the like. 
We’ll include some other happenings in there 
as well. 
 
THREADS 
The party is in search of a giant hideout. 
The mountain where the party is currently 
searching is haunted. They fell in a pit where 
hideous skeletal hands were reaching for them. 
The party found a shrine to an unknown god in 
a cavern with markings in blood. 
 
We will add to this as we continue on, but for 
now, this provides a bit of context to our 
adventure. But what about this map of a 
labyrinth? 
Oracle: is the labyrinth map part of this crude 
shrine? d20=3: No. OK, so it’s a separate piece 
of paper.  
Oracle: Does the map appear to show caverns? 
(as opposed to a constructed dungeon). d20=17: 
Yes. 
OK, they have a map for this place! What does 
that mean in terms of gameplay? It means they

can see the layout of the entire cavern system, 
and can possibly see where it leads, so as a 
result I’m going to give them advantage on 
Perception rolls to discover traps. That’s not 
game-breaking, and fits with the vibe.  
 
Oracle: is the map complete? 
d20=1: No, and… there are notes too. Keyword 
time! 
Keywords: storm, advance, gaping, sceptre. 
Oracle: Is the map wrong? d20=3: No, what is 
there is true.  
 
At the base of the shrine, Marble then notices 
something and stoops to pick it up. A map, showing 
the twists and turns of a labyrinth. 
“It appears to show the layout of these caverns,” 
Marble comments. “And there are notes too… 
‘beware the advancing storm… the goddess reclaims 
her sceptre of ice.’” 
Elsewhere on the map, a gaping chasm is depicted. 
They can see how to get to it, but they discuss what 
the best course of action is here. 
“We don’t even know if this is where the giants are 
lurking!” Brenton says urgently. “These caverns… I 
don’t like them… some evil is at work here!” 
Abulu frowns. “You are fine with just… leaving? 
Not exploring these caves which sit so close to 
Bremen? What if some sort of danger to your village 
lurks within?” 
 
I’m taking a little bit of license here… I know 
from reading the background of Rime of the 
Frostmaiden (as a solo player, my style is 
sometimes to know more than my characters) 
that Auril, the Frostmaiden is causing an 
eternal winter in this area.  
OK, so we have some interesting developments 
here! Abulu is going to make a Persuasion 
check on Brenton Garre, whose Wisdom is 11. 
That’s the DC. Abulu is trying to see whether 
he can persuade the veteran to continue on, into 
the caverns.  
d20+3=7. Fail! 
 
Brenton Garre is unmoved by Abulu’s reasoning. 
“We came to find giants, and that’s what me and my 
men are doing.” 
Abulu digs his heels in. “Well, you’ll have to do it 
without us, then. We need to discover what’s in these 
caves.” 
“No doubt the giants avoid this place!” Brenton 
adds. “They’re probably scared to death of it! There 
is magic at work here, I have no doubt… I can feel 
it…” 
 
So, Brenton is not willing to explore. He takes 
his men out of the cavern.  
Oracle: Will they go in search of the giant 
hideout without Abulu, Marble and Wren? (-3 
unlikely). 
d20-3=14: Yes.  
 
Wren turns to Abulu as Brenton takes his men and 
begins climbing back out of the cavern. “They’re 
going to find the giants without us. They’ll all be 
killed!” 
Abulu shakes his head. “They know they’ve 
outmatched without us,” he says quietly. “They’re 
bluffing.” 
“Yes,” Marble agrees. “They can wait for us…” 
 
I mainly chose for the trio not to go with the 
men so I can demonstrate the Cavern 
Generator, I’m not sure it’s something they 
would normally do. But the oracle rolls 
determined that the Bremen warriors left 
Abulu, Marble and Wren in the caverns, so 
here we are. 
I’ve discovered this first chamber, now I’m 
going to map as I go as we explore these 
caverns.  
All right, so earlier I rolled two exits. One of 
those is the exit to the mountainside, the other 
is unexplored. I’m mapping this on maths quad 
paper, and if any encounter happens, I will prep 
a quick battlemap to serve as the encounter 
area. 
The unexplored exit, as detailed earlier, leads 
to another cavern, so let’s roll on the Cavern 
table again, and the Exits table. 
 
Roughly circular, 30 ft. diameter. Roll twice on 
features table. Three exits. 
FEATURES:  
This cavern is lined with crystals of all colours and 
descriptions. Some huge, some tiny, a myriad of 
colours. 
An underground river runs through this cavern, 
possibly cascading over a waterfall or gathering in a 
large pool. 
 
6d12 roll 
d6 roll to determine Standard or Special: Standard. 
Standard Room. Elements triggered: Trap.  
(Remember I determined that I would give them 
advantage to spot traps due to having the map).  
Trap table roll (Chapter 1-4): Poison gas released. 
Abulu succeeds on Perception check.

This cavern is a site to behold. Crystals glitter on 
every surface, and from an icy wall to the northeast a 
torrent of water bursts, rushing across the width of 
the cavern and disappearing into the far wall. 
“Beautiful,” Marble remarks, looking at the scene. 
“And deadly,” Abulu adds, nodding towards the 
crystals. Above them, a barely noticeable disturbance 
in the air, as of a fine mist rising off a stream. “No 
doubt that’s poisonous.” 
Quickly, the three of them cover their mouths and 
move quickly into an exit that opens up directly to 
their left, and avoids the icy river… 
 
OK, where does this exit lead? Time to roll in 
the second column of the Exit table.  
d100=25: Chasm! 
Wow, there’s only a 4% chance of getting a 
Chasm result on this table, and it’s the first time 
I’ve ever rolled on it! Even though I created the 
table, that seems pretty cool to me. Now I get 
to use the Chasm table! 
Just ahead, the tunnel opens out onto a broad ledge, 
where a ten-foot-wide chasm disappears out of sight. 
Who knows what’s down there? You cannot see the 
bottom. Even for characters with darkvision, it is 
beyond your sight. The tunnel continues on the other 
side Roll 1d2 times on the Features table for your 
immediate surroundings.  
 
FEATURES: 
Monster lair: 35% chance creature is present. 
Pools of strange liquid.  
 
This second result isn’t really appropriate for 
the environment, so I roll again. 
 
This cavern is lined with crystals of all colours and 
descriptions. Some huge, some tiny, a myriad of 
colours. Effects of these crystals? Perhaps they have 
some worth? Or perhaps they hide a Crystal Golem 
or Earth Elemental.  
 
I get the crystal result again… this is starting 
to form a story! Those notes are cool, so I 
might have them encounter one of those 
creatures. Should I check encounter difficulty? I 
think not… I might just have them encounter 
an earth elemental! Mainly because I don’t have 
a pawn/mini for a crystal golem. 
I’ll check the difficulty later.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abulu, Marble and Wren face off against an earth elemental on the edge of a gaping chasm. To create this battlemap I used 
Pathfinder Flip Tiles Darklands Starter Set and Dungeon Craft by 1985 Games.

Quickly rushing from the room, the trio pull up 
quickly as they come to the edge of a chasm. More 
crystals glitter here, and then suddenly, out of the 
wall a creature begins to emerge… formed of the 
very earth itself, with crystals dropping from its 
huge, shambling form, the hulking mound begins 
stalking towards the party, bent it seems on either 
hurling them into the chasm or crushing them into 
dust.  
OK, let’s get into this. Roll initiative. I’m not 
going to detail this blow by blow as I cover 
combat in a separate playthrough.  
 
COMBAT SUMMARY 
Well, Abulu did pretty well, casting spike 
growth and then thorn whip to drag the 
elemental through it, dealing some reasonable 
damage. The other two landed a few attacks 
but when the elemental’s multiattack attack hit 
Marble a few times, it was clear that this 
encounter was near unwinnable for them, even 
with Marble raging. They could have won it, 
but they would have had to burn nearly all 
their abilities, and so the gang jumped across 
that crevasse and fled the hulking creature. 
This encounter was beyond them, and I like 
that.  
But then, Marble had an idea… 
Oracle: does the creature still appear hostile 
towards the characters? (likely +3) 
 
Seeing that this elemental is something they will 
have to face no matter what, Abulu calls down the 
power of the wild goddess Oagi once more. A thorny 
vine whips from his hand, tangles itself around the 
elemental, who lets out a hollow roar as it is 
dragged over the edge of the chasm, to fall and 
disappear into the blackness.  
Wren takes a cautious step forward and cranes her 
neck to look down into the beckoning void.  
“Nice work, fuzzy,” she says in a matter-of-fact 
voice. 
Staying there a while, as if almost expecting the 
thing to rear up from the depths again, the trio are 
finally satisfied the terrifying creature is gone, and 
they turn to progress down the tunnel, pressing on 
further into the system of caverns.  
 
OK, let’s go back to the tunnel table! 
Continue roughly straight 20 ft. Tunnel turns 
right 45 degrees and continues another 10 ft. 
Roll again on this table. 50% chance of a 
Features table roll. 
The features roll comes up, and we get a Cave-
in.  
They reach a spot where the ceiling has caved in.  
Oracle: Is there a way to get past? (50/50). 
d20=6: No.  
“We’ll backtrack,” Abulu says.  
“You mean we’ve got to jump over that ravine 
again?” Wren groans. “What if that horrible thing 
reaches up and grabs my leg?” she half-jokes.  
Making their way back over the narrow chasm, they 
go into the room where the stream ran through, the 
one with five exits, and try a different one, to the 
north.  
 
OK, tunnel roll. The tunnel hairpins, and then 
comes to a cavern. A features roll turns up 
nothing. Let’s roll on the Cavern and Exits 
tables. 
Roughly circular, (d8+1) x 10 diameter. 2 exits, 
Roll twice on Features Table.  
Features table rolls:  
Storage. Someone has been storing things here. 
There are crates, barrels… What’s inside? 
Discover 1 clue. DC 15 Perception check to 
discern out who stored these. Roll on 
Humanoid table. 
Monster hive. Creatures are massed here in a 
colony. Best be stealthy! Roll on monster type 
table in Chapter 5-1. 
Monster type table: Plant. OK, a quick look 
through an online monster list gives me a few 
options for possible plant monsters. Myconids, 
gas spores and quaggoth spore servants. So, in 
a situation like this, I reach for the Monster 
Manual to read a bit of lore and figure out what 
will be the best fit. Any excuse to delve into a 
bit of monster lore! 
So, after a bit of reading, I’m going to conclude 
that, just for a change, we’ll go with something 
more benign.  
 
Stealthily creeping down the new passage, the trio 
are amazed when they make their way into a 
smallish, dark cavern to see a small group of 
creatures with mushroom-like heads… meditating? 
They appear very peaceful. To the left of the cavern, 
some crates and barrels are piled up.  
 
Oracle: Do the myconid talk to the characters? 
Or communicate in any way? 
d20 = 14: Yes. 
Keywords: Monopoly, Slave, Bones, Motive. 
Spores drift in the air around the trio.  
“Poisonous?” Wren asks, backing away. Abulu, 
however, has his eyes closed. “They’re 
communicating with us,” Abulu says. “They say they 
have escaped from below… a great city, where they

---

## Page 274

274 
 
were enslaved by a race of… I can’t make this part 
out… many of their kind died escaping. Now they 
are here, trying to work out their next stage.” 
“Are there more of them?” Marble asks. 
“Yes, many more, in the caverns ahead.” 
At this stage, I’m just going to decide that 
directly ahead, down that exit opposite, is a 
larger cavern containing a huge amount of 
myconid. I’m going to choose the following 
Cavern table result: 
Roughly trapezoidal, (d10+2) x 10 diameter. 
Roll thrice on Features Table. Exits: 3 
Features table rolls: 
This huge cavern (ignore room measurements 
from Cavern table) houses an underground 
settlement. Roll on Unmarked Settlement Table 
from TSAT 1 (p.73). (Wow, that’s appropriate. 
Confirms what I have already). A roll on that 
table produces 10: Refugee encampment. 
Roll on DMG Odours table (p.299). I roll, and 
get Earthy.  
Pools of strange liquid. Maybe these can be 
rapport spores.  
1d4 (3) Features table rolls. 
Rubble & debris 
Graveyard / Boneyard. The skeletons of many 
dead creatures lie here. 
Multiple burrow-like holes pepper the walls 
and floor 
The sight that greets the trio in the next cavern is 
nothing short of incredible. Groups of these strange, 
mushroom-like creatures sit in groups, meditating, 
while clouds of lazy spores hang in the air, giving 
the whole scene a dreamlike effect. This is a colony, a 
settlement of sorts, refugees who escaped the 
enslavement below… Several appear to bear 
wounds, the signs of battle.  
“I wonder…” Marble remarks. “Does this have 
anything to do with the shrine we saw?” 
“Hmmm… I doubt it,” Abulu replies. “But… 
perhaps it is protecting them, in a way. These 
creatures… they deserve safety. They deserve 
refuge.” 
“Well, perhaps we can help with that.” 
Together, the trio press on through the cavern, 
making for the exit on the far side.  
Oracle: Do the myconid react to the characters 
moving towards the far exit? 
d20 = 6: No.  
Exits table roll. What does this exit lead to? 
d100=100: Chasm.  
Whaaat! Another chasm result. That’s rare. OK, 
let’s roll on the Chasm table! 
You are about halfway down the chasm. 
Looking up, you see that it reaches up 1d10 x 
10 feet and is possibly climbable (Athletics 
check?). It also drops 1d10 x 10 feet. Above, 
you can see [d10] (1-3) Open sky (4-6) Ledges, 
off of which run tunnels (7-8) Not much, just a 
chasm rising up, but there might be something 
up there (9-10) Some sort of colony, burrows or 
even structures on the chasm walls. Roll 1d4 
times on the Features table. Drops into a [d10] 
(1-4) Tunnel (5-8) Cavern (9-10) Underground 
lake.  
50% chance the tunnel continues on the other 
side. 
Looking up, they see not much. It reaches up 30 
ft. and down 30 ft. Drops into a tunnel. Passage 
does continue on the other side… A quick 
character sheet check shows that Marble 
possesses rope and Abulu a climber’s kit. Wren 
is fairly dextrous as well so I’m going to make 
ability checks and I determine they can easily 
climb down. 
The trio look down the chasm, which isn’t that deep 
this time.  
“Shall we climb down?” Wren asks. 
Wordlessly, Marble ties off a rope to a nearby 
boulder and the party take turns descending.  
Standing at the bottom of the shallow chasm, they 
see a tunnel leading deeper into the earth. 
“Does it lead to the Nameless Depths?” Abulu 
wonders aloud.  
Wren shivers involuntarily. “We’re a long way from 
home now, friends…” 
As they move forward, they see the carcasses of many 
dead myconid… 
“They died defending this area,” Marble says. 
“Their freedom was hard won.”  
 
So, you can see how this could just keep going 
on forever. With a generator like this, you can 
make a decision to curtail your dungeon by 
restricting its dimensions to the available 
paper, or you could effectively just continue as 
long as you want. Perhaps they discover the 
underground city where the myconid were 
enslaved… this quest could go in many 
directions.  
What I am going to do is have the trio re-join 
the men on the snowy hillside, and track down 
the giant encampment! 
I hope this has shed some light on the process 
of using the Natural Cavern Generator 
contained in Chapter 2-2, and on overland 
travel as well.

PLAYTHROUGH 3: Demonstrating Urban Generator 
and Battlemap Crawl systems 
 
After finishing their last quest, Abulu and 
Marble, a bugbear druid and a warforged 
barbarian (both level 3), set out for the city of 
Rettamund to see what awaits them there. 
Neither have ever visited this northern port 
city before. 
As you read through this playthrough, please 
keep in mind that this is one random 
combination of methods, and there are 
obviously many different ways of running solo 
RPGs. This chapter simply serves the function 
of demonstrating two methods introduced in 
this book.  
 
• 
Chapter 2-1: Urban Generator 
• 
Chapter 1-4: Battlemap Crawl System 
 
You can take whatever you want from this 
chapter and leave everything else. Or you can 
borrow the whole method.  
This playthrough is quite detailed, and 
obviously you don’t have to conform to that 
level of detail. One major consideration is 
whether your game is taking place in a 
homebrew world. If that is the case (as it is 
here), then generally more detail needs to be 
created, as opposed to running a game in an 
already established setting (such as Eberron) 
with rich lore resources. (Ignore the fact that 
the last two chapters have these characters in 
the Forgotten Realms! This is just for 
demonstration). 
 
THE CITY/PRINCIPALITY OF 
RETTAMUND 
I have a small amount of lore concerning this 
city which is situated in my homebrew world, 
but not a lot. It has the usual guilds and other 
things present in the cities that populate my 
world. It has a strange underground library 
where forbidden tomes are kept. And a few 
other things. But everything else I am going to 
generate.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abulu takes long bugbear strides up to the gate, 
grey-plated sentries quickly standing to as they see 
the great lanky man-thing approaching. And at his 
side, a burly automaton, equipped for war, it seemed 
to them. They lower spears. Reaching them, Abulu 
smiles and bows slightly. “Good day, sirs,” he says in 
his deep, mellow voice. “I am Abulu, Druid of the 
Elderwood, and this is my friend Marble. Are 
Rettamund’s doors open to a couple of weary 
travellers?” 
The closed gate behind the sentries doesn’t look too 
sturdy to Abulu, as if a stiff breeze could knock it 
down, but the big druid always liked to be courteous, 
to change people’s minds, to keep them guessing. No 
doubt these sentries thought he was some kind of 
grakthal-kin or wild man from beyond the reach.  
“I study the arcane, and the natural, and I’ve heard 
tell, gentlemen, that the libraries of Rettamund are 
beyond compare. Tell me, do you think it might be 
possible for one to find works by the great mage 
Raffen Garth here, or even the one named 
Xaxofaris?” 
At this, the sentries seem to glaze over a little, and 
glance at each other. One scratches his head, the 
other shrugs, and in unison they step to either side of 
the door. “Welcome, mage,” one drawls in a thick 
northern accent.  
“Druid,” Abulu quietly corrects with a smile and a 
nod as he and Marble walk past.  
 
OK, so here comes the first of my rolls on the 
tables contained within Chapter 2-1: Urban 
Generator / Building Settlements. Keep in 
mind that you don’t have to roll for everything. 
I can decide on certain things to establish, and 
then use those factors to influence later rolls. 
I’m planning on rolling on the Street-by-Street 
tables, to actually map this town out, and just 
as pure exploration for my adventurers. But 
with the Building a Settlement From Scratch 
tables, I’m going to simply select some values 
that I think fit the city of Rettamund, which 
I’ve already established during other 
adventures. If you are encountering your 
settlement for the first time, simply roll on the 
Building a Settlement From Scratch tables to 
get the basic information on your hamlet, 
village, town, city, or metropolis.

RETTAMUND 
Population: City, up to 25,000 
Main humanoid race=human (50%) mix of 
other races (50%) 
Strictness of rule table: Pragmatic leader. Town 
guard that does their job properly, if 
occasionally begrudgingly. 
  
Now, we get to the number of districts. As 
detailed in Chapter 2-1, a city includes 14-24 
districts including Artisan, Commerce, 
Commodities, Divine, Government, Home & 
Hospitality, Military, Residential. I’ll keep it at 
14 (Rettamund isn’t a huge city), which means 
that in addition to the 8 compulsory districts, I 
need to roll for 6 more to make up my self-
made district table. However, there are only 14 
different types of districts on the district table, 
so I simply replicate the districts table (Setup 
Table 5 in the Chapter 2-1: Urban Generator) 
in order to have a tool to determine what 
district my characters are in.

So, what district are they in? A d100 roll of 12 
reveals they are in the Arcane District! Each 
one of these districts also has its own 
Merchants by District table so you can 
establish, building by building, just who has set 
up shop in this neighbourhood.  
Now, time to roll for Disturbance. For this we 
need the Disorder Mod (Pragmatic Leader = 0 
modifier) and the DC for Arcane District (12). 
Let’s roll a d20 and see if it hits 12. We get a 4. 
So, no disturbances here! 
Now, the idea is that we want to start with the 
street that leads into Rettamund from the town 
gate. We’ll map as we go. First, we go to Street 
Table. 
D10 = 5: Street continues (d6+2) x 10 metres 
and comes to a T-junction.  
NOTES: 50% chance of a street event. If 
successful, roll on Street Event Table. Roll on 
Street Description, General Street Activity, 
then again on this table. 10% chance of a roll on 
Random Urban Encounter Table (Chapter 3-2). 
But first, Abulu is a druid, so I want to just roll 
a few merchants to populate this area, to see if 
there is anything he would be interested in.  
So, going to the Merchants by District tables, 
I’m going to roll on the Arcane District 
Merchants table. I’m going to roll for four 
different merchants.  
 
• 
General goods store 
• 
Hedge Mage 
• 
Spell components supplier 
• 
Residence (of a mage, possibly?) 
 
None of these grab Abulu particularly, and so 
the bugbear and the warforged press on! 
Let’s roll for the results from the street table. 
50% street event. D100 = 80, so no street 
event.  
Now for the Street Description Table. D6 = 3: 
Narrow dirt streets, possibly raw sewage, 
cramped businesses or residences. Slumlike.

---

## Page 277

277 
 
General Street Activity Table: Lively. Quite a 
few people in the street, lots of trade, a minstrel 
or two. 
 
Abulu and Marble walk north up the Gate Lane 
towards a T-junction. “That smell,” Abulu mutters, 
covering his mouth. “Not much of a first impression, 
is it?” 
Marble seems to almost smile, if an automaton were 
capable of such a thing. “I am truly grateful for my 
ability to disengage my various senses. It never fails 
to come in handy.” 
Abulu squints at his metal friend. 
Despite the offensive smell, there is plenty of activity 
here. Goods are being traded, wagons unloaded and 
deals struck. This entrance to the city seems to be 
host to transactions between newcomers and resident 
merchants alike.  
The two reach the T-junction and look both ways, 
wondering which route is the best to take.  
“An inn?” Marble suggests. “Should we look for an 
inn?” 
 
10% chance of a random encounter. d100=32. 
No random encounter. 
NOTE: When rolling for chances (e.g., 50% 
chance of a street event), roll a d100. If it is 
equal to or below the percentile score (in this 
case, a result of 50 or below), that thing is 
present/occurs. 
OK, so in this situation I want to randomly 
determine which way my characters go. 
Usually, I’ll just decide but every now and then 
I like to let the dice decide. This is something a 
solo player will always find useful and should 
be able to adapt to any situation - the ability to 
quickly devise dice rolls on the fly to decide 
anything.  
So basically, roll a d6. 1-3=left, 4-6=right.  
d6 = 1. They’re going left. Since they’re 
continuing along a street, I’ll roll the Street 
Table again. 
Street Table. d10 = 10: Street opens into a 
gathering area. d4: 1-2: Market Square, 3-4: 
Public Square. 80% chance this area contains a 
landmark. Go to appropriate tables (Market 
Square, Landmark). 50% chance of a street 
event. 
d4 = 2 so it’s market square. Rolling for 
landmark. d100 = 17, there’s a landmark.  
Roll for street event. d100 = 23, there’s one of 
those too! 
Street Event: 22 Musical / dramatic 
performance. I’m deciding it’s a play. But what 
is it about? Keywords time! 
Keywords: boon, familiar, rainbow.  
 
Market Square Table. 8: This market is in a 
state of (d4) 1-2: Just setting up, 3-4: Just 
packing down. 30% of a Random Urban 
encounter. 
 
d4 = 4 Just packing down. d100 = 91 no 
random encounter.  
They lads decide to ask around for an inn. Can 
they find someone to ask? I’m just going to 
decide yes, they approach someone to ask. But 
who? Let’s make use of the 100 Quick Random 
Citizens table. 4 x d100 rolls.  
Numah, a 65-year-old female dragonborn 
cooper.  
 
Heading a little way east, they come across a market 
square, just in the process of packing down, but with 
a drama in full progress, watched by a good-sized 
rapt audience of children and adults. The story of a 
young boy who found a magical creature that told 
him that a rainbow would appear and show him the 
way to a treasure...  
Abulu approaches a merchant, a female dragonborn 
who is practicing the cooper’s art in her stall. A few 
children stand around and watch as she constructs a 
barrel, her muscular arms taming wood and metal 
to craft the sturdy-looking containers. 
“Excuse me,” Abulu says. “We were wondering if 
you could direct us to the nearest inn.” 
 
Oracle roll. Is Numah friendly towards the 
lads? Using the oracle from Chapter 1-7. 50/50 
so no modifier.  
d20 roll = 3. No.  
 
“Can’t you see I’m busy here? Damn out of towners. 
Go bother someone else.” 
Abulu is quite taken aback by this response. They 
move on, looking to find someone who might be a bit 
more helpful.  
 
Let’s go with the 100 Quick Random Citizens 
again.  
Romina, 25-year-old male half elf fisher. 
Keywords Invite, Identity, Memory. 
Interesting. Does Romina know one of them? 
Hmm I didn’t roll keywords for Numah. I kind 
of did so here to push the story along a bit. It’s 
better if something happens, than something 
not happening. We’ve got limited gaming time, 
right? Let’s kick this thing along a bit! 
Oracle roll Yes, but… he can’t remember where 
from. Which one? d4 roll to decide. 1=Abulu.

---

## Page 278

278 
 
Is this person friendly? d20 oracle roll=18 Yes. 
I’m going to just decide that this person knows 
where an inn is, and then generate the inn 
using an online random tavern generator. 
TSAT1 also has an inn generator (pp.18-20). 
Is the inn nearby? Oracle roll=3 no. But I’m 
not going to generate all that urban terrain. I’m 
just going to fast forward my characters 
straight to the inn (you’re allowed to do this, or 
course! You are acting as DM, so if you want 
you can skip boring bits and just get straight to 
some quest-related action, there’s nothing to 
say that you can’t do this whenever you like. 
To really get to the heart of the matter, you can 
skip all the backstory and just go straight to 
quest generation. Try Chapter 7 of TSAT1 
p.73-74 of Dungeon Master’s Guide, or even 
just roll for a random encounter as appropriate 
to environment and take it from there.  
The Donjon inn generator actually produces 
some great NPCs and rumours which your 
party can receive a quest from.  
 
Marble tries approaching a different citizen, testing 
the waters with a young fishmonger who mans a 
stall towards the edge of the market. This young 
merchant is much friendlier and tells the pair where 
to find an inn.  
“Don’t I know you?” the young half-elf asks Abulu.  
Abulu frowns. “I’m not sure.” 
“You look familiar.” 
 
Does Abulu recognize Romina? 
Oracle roll. 3=No. 
 
After a while trying to determine where this young 
half-elf might have known Abulu from, they part 
ways cordially. Abulu and Marble follow Romina’s 
directions to an inn named The Crossed Spears. 
They walk for some distance through twisting streets 
until they arrive at the inn which is The inn is a 
single storey building of timber and brick walls, 
with a heather-thatched roof.  
(The innkeeper is a willowy female human named 
Heva. She secretly leads a small cult of a demonic 
goddess - this info was generated from Donjon site). 
Abulu and Marble rent rooms and then settle down 
in the main bar (deduct 2 gold).  
 
Do they notice anything unusual about the 
innkeeper? Oracle roll 5=no. 
Roll for inn quality perhaps. Tavern table, 
TSAT1 p.19. You can see I’m just drawing on 
tables as I see fit.  
Average rooms, civil treatment. We’ll say 
they’re 1 gp per night.  
There’s no set structure. The more detail you 
generate, the more there is to interact with.  
Let’s use the TSAT1 Rumour tables (pp.19-20). 
 
Subject of the rumour: Creature. Aberration (I 
generated this result using a table I created 
myself, a monster type table which is in 
Chapter 5-1 of this book). 
Rumour location: In this settlement. 
 
Some interesting rumours circulate in the bar. 
Apparently a creature, an aberration, has been 
terrifying a particular area of the city.  
 
Let’s set this up. This can potentially be a 
BBEG (big bad evil guy or boss monster) 
encounter for my characters. This is a great 
example of a situation that can come up in a 
solo game where you just need to make a call. 
Do I reveal the identity of the creature 
terrorising this particular district now? Or 
later, as a result of clues I pick up? 
I think the latter is much more interesting, and 
is going to make for a much richer game. I will 
base the identity of the creature on what clues I 
pick up during the adventure. So, we’ll put 
aside the generation of the BBEG for now. I 
know for a fact that I have the tools to generate 
appropriate monster CR etc, and I will 
definitely make it a hard, or even deadly fight 
for my lads.  
A few rolls on the 100 quick citizens table 
(TSAT2, p__) to produce a couple of NPCs.  
Quill, 22 year old male half-elf drunkard 
Stefan 15 year old male human bandit captain.  
Transpose into present tense.  
 
Supping an ale while Marble watches the bar 
impassively, Abulu’s keen senses are drawn to a 
conversation happening at the end of the bar. A 
couple of youngsters are getting rather drunk on the 
tap ale and telling an interesting story.  
“My uncle, he says there’s a… hic… hahahaa… a 
revolting beast terrifying the neighbourhood…” 
“Ha, well, we’ve all met Todrick!” 
This comment reduces both of them into helpless, 
prone idiots shaking with laughter on the floor.  
“No, you idiot!” the first one manages finally. 
“An… an actual monster!” 
The other flops a hand dismissively, getting up into 
a sitting position as he does so. “Pfah! What 
nonsense. Rettamund has stood here for hundreds of 
years! No threat comes near anymore! Bagnarath or

whatever his name was from over there,” he waved a 
hand vaguely north, indicating the nation of 
Kurakut who had once, foolishly attempted an 
invasion of Farveld, “Was the last to try and 
lookwhathappenedtohim!” The young vagabond, a 
rough-looking very young human lad, took a long 
swig of ale. 
“Sent home with his bloody tale between his legs!” 
his half-elf friend, not much older, exclaimed. “But 
hang on, you know there’s tunnels…” 
As they were having this conversation, the two were 
slowly getting upright after falling off their chairs 
in laughter, and were just now seating themselves 
again when an eight-foot-tall bugbear approaches 
them, bearing himself with a quiet and cautious 
demeanour, and speaking softly… 
“Gentlemen!” he addresses them, then turned to the 
slightly older half-elf. “Did I hear you just now 
speak of monsters?” 
 
Normally here I would make an oracle roll to 
see if they were friendly towards Abulu, but 
since this is setting up my quest, I’m just going 
to decide that they are friendly. This is the sort 
of thing that a DM does as a matter of course, 
but sometimes we as solo players just need to 
make these things happen.  
Let’s make a few keyword rolls to add some 
extra flavour. Do that whenever.  
Keywords: gaping, premonition, communion 
 
“I did, sir,” the half-elf youngster tells Abulu. 
“My… uncle is a priest at a temple in the city. A 
huge hole appeared in their basement one night… at 
the same time, many young novices who were living 
in the dormitories died…” the young drunkard goes 
quieter, realizing that he shouldn’t have been joking 
about such a thing.  
“I see,” Abulu says, looking between them.  
“Then the monster started travelling out a bit 
further… beyond the temple. It would come at night, 
and terrorize the neighbourhood.” 
The human lad, the one who looked a bit rough, 
chimes in. “Why haven’t the guard done anything? 
The… whatcha call ‘em… Imperial Blades? Bloody 
useless lot they are!” 
“They want to keep it quiet,” his friend replies. 
“Don’t want people panicking and such, I s’pose…” 
Abulu thinks on this. “Where is this temple?” he asks 
after a while.  
 
These two give our lads directions to the 
temple. Let’s figure out what god it is, as this 
can flavour the quest. Now, elves are very rare 
in this world. Since this youngster is a half-elf, 
I’m going to say that his dad is human who had 
a bit of a liaison with an elven maiden. So, a 
human god… consulting my pantheon… 
Callister, Goddess of Understanding, Order, 
and Arcane Mysteries. This temple is in the 
(rolling on District table) Residential district. 
Makes sense, given that the monster is ranging 
out and killing citizens. A d4 roll reveals that it 
is a thriving district (mercantile, perhaps).  
 
“Anything of interest?” Marble asks as Abulu 
returns to his place at the bar.  
The druid nods and takes a long chug of mead. 
“Indeed, friend,” he replies. “A task for two new 
arrivals, perhaps.” 
“Oh?” 
“Yes, one that the local guard is trying to sweep 
under the rug, it seems. But it will wait until 
tomorrow. I need rest, even though you don’t, my 
metal friend.”  
 
Quick roll on a weather table (TSAT1, p.14) 
 
A steady rain beats down on the cobbled streets of 
Rettamund as Abulu and Marble trudge forward in 
the rain, head down. Despite the miserable weather, 
the streets are thronged with merchants and citizens 
going about their everyday business. It seems a bit of 
rain doesn’t bring the gears of industry grinding to 
a halt in this town.  
It doesn’t take long for the lads to reach the Callister 
temple, tucked within the heart of a busy mercantile 
residential area. The houses here are well-
constructed, a mix of stone and wood, and the temple 
itself is a beautiful, elegant structure.  
 
Can they see any damage from the outside? 
Oracle roll d20=9. No, but… 
When you get a No, but result, then some more 
detail is required. And what better way to 
provide it than keywords! 
Keywords: village, agreement, escape 
 
They don’t see any obvious damage to the temple or 
its front door, but building supplies are nearby, and 
workers can be seen moving cement and tools away 
from the area. Marble approaches one of them.  
 
Ridley, 93-year-old female kenku builder 
(Deciding profession, based on the situation).  
 
The bird-like humanoid regards Marble curiously.  
“A few repairs, eh?” 
She nods slowly. “Yes. You’ve heard?”

“Hmm, something of it. A creature, finding its way 
up from below, beneath this temple.” 
The bird makes a strange clicking noise, seemingly 
of disapproval. “That’s right,” it squawks. “Who 
knows how they’re going to get on top of this 
kerfuffle!” 
Abulu smiles benignly. “Thank you, friend,” he says, 
patting the kenku on her shoulder, then motions 
towards the temple. “Come on, let’s go take a look.” 
“Right you are, sir,” Marble replies. 
 
Now I’m going to a resource called GM’s 
Miscellany: Urban dressing to provide a bit of 
detail for this temple. It tells me that the 
temple itself has a kind of silent, soundproofed 
quality. A sanctum of peace… apparently.  
Oracle question: Is the main temple currently 
occupied? (likely +3) d20 roll=2 (+3) 5=no.  
Does the inner temple show any signs of 
damage? (likely +3) d20 roll=9 (+3) 12=yes, 
but. A yes, but result also requires keywords to 
provide detail. 
Keywords: silver, celebration, guide.  
 
Entering the temple, the pair are astonished to find 
the noise of the street outside all but vanish. The 
temple is empty, and a thick silence permeates the 
inner sanctum.  
“Where are the monks?” Marble asks, his voice softly 
echoing off smooth white granite walls. Abulu 
simply shakes his head. To their left, a large idol of 
Callister occupies the altar, a seated form with a 
book on her lap. The idol itself shows some damage, 
but the silverwork (the idol is a combination of 
marble and silver) is untouched. There are also 
multiple offerings scattered about the base of the 
altar which have been disturbed, possibly the remains 
of a recent festival or celebration. Abulu quietly 
inspects these, then motions to Marble to follow him.  
Quietly, the large bugbear and his metallic friend 
creep further within the building, which seems to 
guide them onwards.  
 
OK, so at this stage I’m going to switch this to 
a dungeon crawl! I’m going to use the dungeon 
generation chapter from TSAT1 (Chapter 8) 
and also the Temple or Shrine Room table from 
Dungeon Master’s Guide (p.294).  
You can see that it is possible to use many 
different resources to add flavour to your solo 
game. However, you can also just get by with 
using keywords. Taking the last set of 
keywords (silver, celebration, guide) we could 
use that to generate a random room in a 
temple. Where they keep all the silverware that 
they use for celebrations? And there is a map in 
this room that can guide you through the rest 
of the temple.  
But since, as a dungeon master, I possess a lot 
of resources for running games, I like to use 
these while soloing. It adds a lot of richness to 
the game. 
So, I’m keeping in mind that there is an area on 
a lower level where the aberration is getting in. 
I’m going to keep this in mind as I’m 
generating the temple layout.  
We know the starting area is the main temple 
room that runs off the street (we’ve just decided 
that). So, we’ll generate from there. Quite often 
when I generate a dungeon for a solo 
adventure, I don’t bother filling in the details of 
every passage and room in my adventure 
journal. I just go through the adventure and 
then summarise in the journal at the end. But 
for the purposes of showing you how I use 
these tools, I will do it blow for blow.  
Also, I’m thinking that the upper level might 
have less passages and more rooms. So, every 
time I make a passage roll, I’m going to roll 
twice and choose what I think is the most 
suitable result.  
Let’s get started. What is beyond this room? 
I’m going to make a d4 roll. 1-2: Room, 3-4: 
Passage. 
Result 3: Passage. Let’s go to the Passage table 
in chapter 8 of TSAT1. Alternately you could 
use the Dungeon Master’s Guide dungeon 
generator which starts on p.290.  
2 Passage rolls, and choose the most 
appropriate. A 19 and a 20! 
19 is Opening in the floor, straight drop down 
1d10 x 10 ft to a (1d4 roll) 1-2: Passage, 3-4: 
Room. 
Well hell. This fits perfectly with my story, so 
I’m using that! 
 
As they enter the chamber adjoining the front temple 
room, they see it. A huge, gaping hole in the floor, 
descending down into blackness… 
“This would appear to be where the fiend is getting 
in,” Marble says drily. Abulu shoots him a withering 
look. “Are you speaking in jest, my friend? I can’t 
even tell anymore!” 
 
Oracle: Can they see the bottom? d20=Yes, 
but… it’s a long way down.  
Temple or Shrine Table (DMG): 92=Well for 
drinking water. The plot thickens! 
Can they see water at the bottom? (Likely +3) 
18: Yes.

---

## Page 281

281 
 
Let’s roll for some room contents here. We’ll 
do a 6d12 roll (see Chapter 1-3) using the… 
Special Room table. I’m choosing Special Room 
because this is kind of a pivotal room in the 
story. From the 6d12 roll I get a clue, 2 
features and a trap.  
Let’s roll the clue first. For this you could use 
keywords, or the dungeon clue table in Chapter 
8 of TSAT1. I’m going to use keywords. 
Gossip - command - silence. 
A protective rune of some sort? For some 
reason that’s what those words suggest to me. 
Does the rune have any effect right now? d20: 
20! Yes, and…  
Is it a bad effect? (Likely +3) d20: 7+3=10. 
Maybe. Skill roll! 
 
“How do we get down there?” Marble asks. “It 
would be handy if there was someone here to talk 
to!” 
“Here, look,” Abulu says quietly, directing Marble’s 
attention to where a rune is painted on the wall.  
Too late, Abulu realizes that this is in fact a trap 
glyph, no doubt scribed here by the priests who 
formerly inhabited this now silent temple. A bolt of 
fire shoots out from the glyph towards him! Quickly 
he goes to duck out of the way… 
 
Dex save for Abulu. He rolls a 10, so we are 
going to say it is highly unlikely (-5) he dodges 
the fire.  
Oracle: Can Abulu dodge the fire bolt? d20: 17-
5=12. Yes, but… 
I interpret that as him taking half damage. I’m 
going to roll a d100 on the Trap table to 
determine damage dice. 
Please roll low. Please roll low…. 
d100: 8. Whew! 1d6 damage. The d6 roll is a 6, 
so Abulu takes 3 damage.  
 
But it catches him just on the shoulder, and the fire 
quickly spreads. Marble acts quickly, dousing his 
furry friend with a bucket that just happens to have 
some dregs of water sloshing around in the bottom. 
“Thanks,” Abulu says, somewhat shaken, and slowly 
getting to his feet.  
 
Let’s generate the rest of the adventure 
elements. We’ve got two features, and another 
trap. This isn’t surprising! These traps were 
put here to slow the creature down. I’m 
thinking the lads will be a bit on edge now, so 
they might have a better chance of seeing it. I 
might grant them advantage to notice the next 
trap.  
Features. I’m going to roll on the Dungeon 
Features Table, found in Chapter 1-3.  
I get a door, and an interesting floor.  
I’m going to use GM’s Miscellany: Dungeon 
Dressing to provide details, although from 
looking at the Dungeon Features Table you’ll 
see there are quite a few different resources you 
can use to provide dungeon dressing.  
Door: The door is actually a large painting 
surrounded by a wide, gold leaf frame. The 
“door” opens outwards and swings to the left. 
Interesting Floor: Dozens of marbles cover 
the floor. Characters moving at full speed 
through them must make a DC 14 Reflex save 
or fall prone. 
Trap: Poison Gas, Notice DC 18, Save DC 20, 
Damage: PC Level x 2d6 (6d6!). 
Do they notice the trap? Perception checks for 
both. Abulu gets a 23! 
 
Moving to the other side of the well, they see an 
interesting painting, depicting mythology of 
Callister. Marble moves closer, and sees that the 
painting is a door, and that it is slightly ajar. And 
the floor is littered with marbles.  
“Another trap, obviously,” Marble says. “My 
namesake, as it happens.” 
Abulu peers over to where Marble is standing. 
“How droll. I’ve found another trap too.” He 
indicates a tripwire. “Who knows what this one 
does…” 
“Well, there’s no getting down that well. We might 
as well see if there is another way down to the lower 
levels.” 
They move through the painted door, into whatever 
lies beyond… 
 
I’m going to repeat the d4 roll I did before, just 
because this isn’t a dungeon. 4: Passage. 
Let’s roll twice, as we did before, and choose 
the best result. That is just something I’ve 
decided to do on this adventure.  
I got 20 twice!! If only my attack rolls were 
that good. Sigh.  
Random architecture it is. I’ll roll twice on the 
Random Architecture Table too. 
13 and 14. Trapdoor with ladder, or 
underground stream. I know what one I’m 
choosing. But first, let’s determine what type of 
room this is, within this temple.  
22: Central Temple built to accommodate 
rituals. 
6d12 roll. Let’s see what that turns up… We’ll 
use Standard Room for this one.

---

## Page 282

282 
 
I just get 1 clue this time. Let’s use the 
Dungeon Clue Table (TSAT1, p.52). 
74: A cauldron sits in the corner.  
 
“A trapdoor, Abulu, look!” 
Abulu moves through after Marble, and immediately 
sees it. There, in the middle of the floor, a trapdoor. 
Lifting it open, they see a ladder descending down to 
the lower levels.  
This room is interesting. A large cauldron sits in the 
corner, and there are various ritualistic utensils.  
“What went on in here?” Abulu mused to himself. 
“Some sort of ritual?” 
 
 
 
Oracle: Does it look like the sort of thing that 
Callister worshippers would do (keeping in 
mind she’s kind of a lawful good deity)? d20 = 
18: Yes, it does.  
 
It looks fairly standard for devotees of Callister. 
Perhaps a large offering was being created.  
Marble, looking down where the ladder 
descends, slowly begins climbing down… 
 
 
 
BATTLMAP CRAWL SYSTEM / SETUP 
OK, so from here I’m going to take the 
opportunity to implement/demonstrate the 
Battlemap Crawl system, as detailed in Chapter 
1-4. This system is ideal for my current party 
as it is designed for 2 PCs.  
First of all, I’m going to sketch out a very quick 
map on quad paper with a basic layout that I 
think will suit this adventure. As recommended 
in that chapter, a 5-room dungeon is an ideal 
size for this style of quest. So, I’ll make a five-
room dungeon. You could even use a random 
dungeon generator to do this. I used the one in 
the Dungeon Master’s Guide to generate the 
dungeon pictured adjacent. 
The DMG is also very useful for naming rooms 
(and many other things related to solo 
adventures). As mentioned, I’m using the 
Temple/Shrine table found on p.294 of the 
DMG to give me names/uses for each room. 
This helps to add to the narrative of your story. 
The more you have to interact with, the better. 
Now that I have a basic battlemap, I’m going to 
add Story Events to it, as per the Battlemap 
Crawl System. I’m simply going to place one 
Story Event in each room, in the form of circled 
numbers. You can see them on the pictured 
map. When I reach these, I will generate Story 
Events which will help to form the overall 
narrative of the quest.  
The image to the left shows how my dungeon 
looks (after I cut it out in photoshop and added 
a black background!). Of course, my characters 
have no knowledge of this layout. I’m acting as 
pseudo-DM of this dungeon, that is, I have a 
little more knowledge of what’s going on than 
my characters. The excitement in this style of 
solo adventuring lies in how my characters 
react to and cope with events, some of which I 
may determine with dice rolls. You can 
randomise some of your PC actions (although I 
usually decide 95% of that stuff myself). 
However, even as pseudo-DM, I still don’t have 
all the knowledge. The things I don’t know will 
be determined by how the adventure unfolds, 
and will require oracle and keyword rolls, and 
the generation of clues which, together, will all 
point towards an end resolution/BBEG battle. 
As you can see, there’s a fair bit of creative 
thinking involved. However, tables like the 
BBEG table help the story make sense 
according to character level and quest context.  
 
So, I can either drop this into a VTT so I can 
get it to the right size and move tokens around 
on it, or the other option is to map it out with

---

## Page 283

283 
 
flipmats or map tiles so I can use minis. Or, I 
could just map it out one room at a time, on a 
flipmat for example. 
I’m going to use a VTT today as I’m limited on 
tabletop space. Let’s get into it.  
Going through the other aspects of setup for a 
Battlemap Crawl quest, I think they’re already 
in place.  
Character creation - done.  
Quest type - already established (they’re 
looking for the hole where the monster gets in 
and trying to stop it).  
Story Events - done. 
All that remains is Enemy Setup. I got the 
result of aberration before when I was 
determining the “subject of the rumour” while 
talking to those two lads at the tavern. So, I’m 
going to generate my Minion, Soldier and 
Leader monsters within the aberration type 
(Random Monster Type Table - Chapter 5-1). 
I’ll decide the BBEG when I come to it.    
  
RANKED MONSTERS 
Minion (CR ⅛): Flumph, Neogi Hatchling, 
Slaad Tadpole 
Soldier (CR ¼): Star Spawn Grue 
Leader (CR ½): Gazer 
 
Now, as per the system, we roll initiative. This 
initiative stays for the duration of the quest. 
And the Event Roll / Monster Roll is always 0. 
Obviously, read Chapter 1-4 for a complete 
description of all these rules.  
 
INITIATIVE 
18  Marble (warforged barbarian) 
6 
Abulu (bugbear druid) 
0 
Event Roll / Monster Roll 
 
 
Okay! Now that that’s all set up, we are ready 
to begin with the first Hero Phase! Marble goes 
first. He is going to move 30 ft. Before he does 
that, I’m going to have him make a Stealth 
check, just for flavour more than anything.  
d20+1=3, oosh! That’s one clanky warforged! 
Now that he’s moved, I make a Move roll for 
Marble, which produces no result. Now Abulu 
follows suit, moving and making a Move Table 
roll.  
Neither of them turn up anything from their 
Move Table rolls, which is not unusual for a 
round of play using this system.  
 
 
 
Next, Event Table roll, which produces the 
result Winds of Darkness: Hero movement is 
reduced by 5 ft. for the next round. I mark an X 
in the checkbox next to this, in pencil.  
Okay, no problem. 
New round, new move. Marble moves 25 ft., 
nothing. Abulu moves and gets a Clue Found 
result. A roll on the Item Table (Chapter 4-3) 
turns up some rubble & debris. Abulu gains a 
Clue Point. 
 
Creeping deeper within the temple’s depths, they 
cautiously follow a passage that turns right. Abulu 
notes rubble and debris on the floor, and can see 
where some nearby masonry is damaged. 
“Something came through here in a hurry,” he 
breathes quietly. “Something big!” 
 
You can see how these rolls begin to form a 
story. Let’s make another Event Table Roll. 
Now we get Blessed Quickening: Heroes’ 
movement is increased by 5 ft. for this round. 
This is the exact opposite of the last roll! All 
good, as we mark it with an X, it won’t recur 
until we either fill all the checkboxes, or get the 
Shuffle result. The table is designed to mimic a 
small deck of cards in how it generates results.

---

## Page 284

284 
 
Marble moves, and rolls for an item Result. A 
roll on the Item table gives us… more rubble 
and debris! This is a result that appears a few 
times (23 times in a list of 400) so don’t be 
surprised if it appears in your game too. This is 
a dungeon, after all. Rubble and debris is not 
uncommon! 
Abulu moves, also turns up a mundane item, 
which just happens to be an ink pen. How very 
curious… 
This is a Guardroom, as noted on the map.  
Oracle: Is this pen resting on a book? d20=7: 
no. Just a pen, lying on the floor, eh? Abulu 
picks it up and pockets it.  
Room Contents table: d100=83 Monster with 
treasure (hoard).  
The Room Contents table is an optional table you 
can roll on if you want to provide even more 
action for your characters to interact with. It 
can also have the effect of generating a lot more 
monster encounters. 
OK, so there’s a monster in here. We should 
deal with that first before anything else… Let’s 
make a roll on the Standard Encounter table! 
d10=8 Hard: 1 Soldier, 1 Leader. Based on the 
short list I’ve generated, that is 1 Star Spawn 
Grue, and 1 Gazer. Mark an X under that box, 
which greatly reduces the chances of it 
recurring again.  
OK, determining surprise. Players make Stealth 
checks vs the monsters’ passive Perception. 
Abulu gets 22 but Marble only 7! No surprises 
here, his Stealth has not been doing well. 
I roll a d12 to determine how far away these 
monsters are and get a 3 and a 2. That’s close! 
OK let’s run this combat! Reading through the 
monster description for the Star Spawn Grue 
(Mordenkainen’s) I’m struck by how suited this 
monster is to this story! It is a good idea to do 
this. The descriptions given in the core books 
are great for generating rich lore within your 
quest. 
 
“Look, there’s a chamber up there!” Marble says 
quietly, then creeps forward.  
“Wait,” Abulu hisses, but before he can do anything 
his friend is entering the room. He hears a shout of 
alarm and sees Marble draw his weapon as a 
horrific creature unlike anything he has ever seen 
advances. Indeed, such a hideous malformation of 
life should not even exist in this world! And then he 
sees another - a tiny, floating ball with eyes on stems, 
like the dreaded beholder, but much smaller! 
Quickly Abulu rushes forward to help his friend, 
phrasing chants of natural magic as he strides 
quickly towards the chamber… 
I’m not going to give a blow-by-blow of the 
combat here. But I will say that, in relation to 
solo gaming, and especially this system, a 
monster AI is required to add some 
unpredictability to monster actions. In the 
Battlemap Crawl system, this is taken care of 
by the monster table roll. This is done after the 
event roll when monsters are in play and 
determines what they do, and which of the 
monsters act on that turn.  
If you are not using this system, you could use 
the Random Monster AI table, found in Chapter 
5-1, and demonstrated in Playthrough 1. 
The lads dispatch these horrific fiends without 
too much bother.  
 
Swinging his greatsword, Marble deals with the 
spindly, crawling thing while Abulu tackles the 
gazers… One more spawns out of nowhere. 
Flinging a flaming sphere to and fro, the bugbear 
druid smashes the hideous monstrosities repeatedly, 
as both of them try to resist the deadly eye rays. At 
one stage, one of the gazers re-animates after Abulu 
has killed it. Eventually though, they dispatch the 
aberrations...  
 
OK now that the monsters are dealt with, let’s 
see what else we can see in this guardroom. 
Also, the room result was Monster with Hoard 
so we’re going to roll on the Hoard Table in 
the DMG for CR 0-4.  
 
CR ½ Hoard: 2000 cp, 800 sp, 80 gp, 
Bloodstone (50 gp), 2 x Carnelian (50 gp), 3 x 
Chalcedony (50 gp), Chrysoprase (50 gp), 
Citrine (50 gp), Quartz (50 gp), Star rose quartz 
(50 gp), Zircon (50 gp), Quaal's Feather Token 
(whip) (rare, DMG 188), Potion of Frost Giant 
Strength (rare, DMG 187), Potion of 
Invulnerability (rare, DMG 188).  
ADD TO INVENTORY 
 
Wow. Quaal’s Feather Token, the whip, is 
basically a bonus action attack every round for 
Abulu. We are going to roll on the Dungeon 
Master’s Guide table General Furnishings and 
Appointments, found on p.299. You could use 
any dungeon dressing table you like, however. I 
like the DMG though, as you may have 
gathered in the course of reading this book! It 
really is an indispensable book for solo D&D 
players. 
Shelf, fireplace and wood, table (long), charcoal, 
butt (huge cask, 125 gallons).

Even just those few details paint a bit more of a 
picture, and give my characters something to 
interact with.  
Is there anything on the table? d20=14 Yes. 
What?  
Keywords: luminescent, fall, knowledge.  
That’s a book of knowledge sitting on the table. 
It’s illuminating but also deals with a fall of 
some kind… a fall from grace? 
I’m going to make an event table roll, and then 
I’m going to deal with the story point that I’ve 
placed in this room.  
Event Table roll. Back Foot: Until the next 
round, no creature can take the Disengage, 
Dash, Hide or Dodge actions. 
 
STORY POINT 
To deal with story points, we roll on the Story 
Point Table to get a generic direction then roll 
a few keywords to provide flavour.  
Story Point Table roll. Bane: Roll on Bane 
table (reference). The character who first 
triggered the Story Point suffers the effect of 
this bane. 
Keywords: woven, weather, crack. 
Since Marble entered the room first, I’ll have 
him suffer the effects of the Bane table.  
Clumsy: You just can’t seem to co-ordinate 
yourself today. You have disadvantage on all 
Dexterity-based checks and saving throws until 
you finish your next combat encounter. 
 
From out of nowhere, a huge crack like thunder 
reverberates through the very stone itself. Abulu 
drops into a defensive pose immediately, while 
Marble reflexively draws his greatsword. The 
ground buckles slightly and gives way, cobbles 
trembling as it seems the building could drop down 
on top of them at any moment, and all is suffused 
with a violent, purplish energy, many strands 
weaving together through the air, the stone of the 
walls, the floor. This energy takes hold of Marble’s 
leg and he gives a metallic cry of pain as he drops 
down to his knees… Abulu rushes to his friend’s side 
to help him up. The normally strong automaton is 
shaky as he stands, using his greatsword to get 
himself upright again.  
Gradually the chaos dies down and the two of them 
look around, inspecting the surroundings. This 
guardroom is fairly basic, with a small fireplace and 
mantle, a bucket of coal, a long table (presumably 
where the guards took their meals), and a massive 
cask with a tap.  
“These guards liked their ale,” Abulu says giving the 
tap a sniff.  
“What’s this?” Marble asks, indicating a book that 
sat at one end of the long table. Abulu comes near. 
Gingerly taking the tome in a huge, furred hand, he 
glances at Marble and then slowly opens the book. 
It is a journal of sorts… written by one of the 
priests, and talks of the dark knowledge they 
discovered here, in a lower part of this temple’s 
basement. Ancient runes, the source of which were 
unknown. But when they began meddling, that’s 
when the creature began to appear… 
Abulu slams the book shut, replacing it on the table. 
“Clergy dabbling in things they know nothing of. 
Dangerous… foolish! Let’s put an end to this, my 
friend!” 
 
OK, the lads move east to the door. Let’s roll 
on a random Door Table. In the Battlemap 
Crawl chapter (1-5) there is a large table titled 
Dungeon Features / What’s On The Map? This 
table allows you to provide detail for any 
features you can see on the battlemap you are 
using for this quest. On the row that deals with 
doors, we see that we have four different 
resources to choose from. Some of these 
provide a very basic door description, such as 
Dungeon Master’s Guide. Others provide rich 
detail. You may possess further door tables 
which you might prefer to roll on, but for the 
purposes of this game I’m going to use the 
GM’s Miscellany: Dungeon Dressing resource to 
provide my door roll.  
 
d100=01: There is no readily apparent handle 
or latch on the portal. A mechanism is hidden 
nearby (DC 20 Perception locates). 
 
I don’t like this result. Because, the way this 
dungeon is constructed, if they fail the 
Perception check, then they can’t progress. 
However, who has the highest Perception… 
Abulu, with a +4. I’m going to say that Marble 
can take the Help action. 
d20=17. Even with advantage, he can’t locate 
it.  
OK, we need more detail here. I’m going to roll 
on the DMG door table as well.  
d20=11: Wooden, barred or locked. 
 
“Someone’s barred this from the other side,” Marble 
says, pushing hard on the door.  
“There must be a catch, a mechanism…” Abulu 
begins searching. Marble lends a hand for a few 
minutes, without success, before declaring. “I’ve got a 
better idea.” The barbarian draws his greatsword 
and draws it back over his head.

“Wait, Marble! You’ll damage your blade…” 
Whispering an incantation, Abulu summons a 
sphere of fire, and begins slamming it into the door. 
Soon the way is clear. But what awaits on the other 
side... 
 
OK, so that’s a fair trade-off. Abulu loses a spell 
slot because they couldn’t find the mechanism. 
Also, I’m going to add the condition that they 
can no longer gain surprise on monsters due to 
the racket that would have created. 
New room! 
OK, so moving to the door and taking actions 
to destroy constitutes the Hero Phase. I should 
also roll on the Move table (which I kind of 
forgot to do, due to dealing with the door).  
Abulu’s roll of 19 triggers a combat encounter! 
I like the idea that they bust down the door, 
and then monsters just come flooding through! 
Let’s roll on the Standard Encounter table. We 
might have to use some healing surges here! 
d10=8 which is the hard encounter, but we’ve 
already had that (we marked it with X earlier), 
so reroll.  
d10=2 which is easy. Phew. We now have two 
marks on the Standard Encounter table, meaning 
that only medium and deadly encounters are 
left, unless we hit 10 before that, which will 
cause us to erase all marks and start again. 
 
Easy: 1 soldier and 2 minions. We’re going 
with a star spawn grue and 2 slaad tadpoles. 
I roll a d12 to determine distance - 1! This fits 
with the situation. Immediately, they are right 
on my guys. 
Now, time for Event table roll, then Monster 
table roll.  
53: Dark Quickening: If monsters are present: 
1d4-1 random enemies get one free attack 
(minimum 1). 
And of course, whenever you make an Event 
table roll, remember to mark it with an X so it 
doesn’t recur. 
I rolled a 1 on the d4, so I’m going to have one 
of the tadpole’s attack (roll a d4 to determine 
character) Marble. 
Running the encounter, I’m not going to detail 
it all. I go through each round, having my 
characters take an action, then an event table 
and monster table roll each round.  
This so-called easy encounter actually saps a 
few hit points from my party! Time to heal. The 
lads will take a short rest, Marble bludges a 
healing potion off of Abulu, and then it’s 
onward! 
OK, they’ve encountered monsters in this room 
so I won’t roll for Room Contents here, but I 
will make a few rolls on Religious Articles and 
Furnishings table from p.300 of Dungeon 
Master’s Guide. This table makes sense since 
we’re in the robing room of a temple. 
Lamp, Tripod, Prayer Rug, Stand. And of 
course, robes.  
Are there any robes in the room? (highly likely 
+5). d20=6+5=11. Yes, but.  
Keywords: Overexcited, Heart, Effigy. 
 
Several robes stand on upright dummies, all of them 
emblazoned with the emblems of Callister. In the 
corner, a chest of robes has been rifled through, and 
the contents scattered on the floor. Was someone 
searching for something here?  
Abulu and Marble continue, moving over to the door 
in the north wall… 
 
Let’s roll on the Story Point table.  
Clue: Roll on Item table and gain 1 Clue Point. 
Keywords: Son, Fluttering, Guide. 
Item Table Roll: Club. 
Oracle: Is this club marked, spattered in blood 
or anything? 
d20=2: No, and… 
Keywords: Temperature, Warrant, Girl.  
Oracle: Is it being wielded by someone? 
d20=12: Yes, but… 
Keywords: City, Damage, Temple. 
 
The pair hear a sound coming from nearby. To the 
side of the room, cowering under a broken table that 
has been upended, a girl is hiding, clutching a crude 
club. She appears to be an acolyte of the temple, and 
is quite young, but is obviously terrified. She is 
breathing quickly.  
“Don’t be scared, child,” Abulu says, extending a 
large paw. “We’re here to help you. To rid this place 
of these demons. You will be safe with us.” 
 
Oracle: does she talk? d20=9: No, but… she 
nods. It seems like she trusts Abulu, and will 
come with the lads, even though she doesn’t 
give her name or anything like that.  
 
OK, short rest done. They’ve moved, so let’s 
make a Move table roll then we’ll do an Event 
table roll. We’re not being super strict here, but 
in general I have the characters do something, 
then there’s an Event table roll.  
Two “no results” from the Move table, let’s 
move to Event table roll.

---

## Page 287

Carnage: Until the next round, the first attack 
of each character and enemy who attacks is 
made with advantage. 
Back to Hero Phase. The lads will move again. 
They do, and once again get no result from 
their move roll (that’s fine). Door table roll. 
There’s also a passage ahead.  
Oracle: Can they hear anything coming from 
down the passage? 
d20=17: Yes. Let’s roll on the Dungeon Master’s 
Guide Noises table (p.298).  
 
Creeping down the passageway, they come to a door 
in the left-hand wall. An elaborate baroque 
doorknocker is fixed to the door. The passage ahead 
climbs some stairs… and from that direction, they 
can hear a humming noise…  
Marble turns to their recent acquaintance. The girl 
looks stricken with fear. 
“Do you know what that noise is?” Marble 
demands.  
“Quiet, Marble,” Abulu growls sharply. “I’m trying 
to listen…” 
 
Oracle: Is the humming musical? d20=18: Yes.  
Is it a song that anyone of them knows? 
D20 = 20: Yes and… 
Keywords: Foliage, Fancy, Decayed, Many. 
Is it a spell that Abulu hears being cast? 
Summoning some animated foliage? Or perhaps 
a horde of decayed creatures of some sort, all 
making some horrific chant in unison, a 
summoning ritual? The word fancy suggests 
that the song is elaborate, ornate. Something is 
telling me that I should read some monster lore 
here… what is this noise? We’ve already 
selected aberrations as a theme, so now let’s 
look at the BBEG table in Chapter 1-4 to see 
what level creature will be the final boss… Cos 
I’m kind of feeling in the mood for the boss 
encounter! 
We can either go 1 x CR 2 (Hard) or 2 x CR 1. 
Well, I like a challenge, so it’s number 2. 2 
Chokers! This then, is the horrid creature that’s 
been coming up through the temple, going out 
into the city and choking people in their sleep! 
And they have the ability to hum? 
Creeeeppppyyyy….. 
 
“Something has been summoned!” he barks, and 
immediately begins changing shape… dropping 
down onto all fours his massive bugbear body grows 
even larger, if that is even possible, and furrier, if 
that is possible! Huge, hunched shoulders bulge out 
and an elongated, ursine maw extends out as his 
skull changes shape. Soon, the shape of a massive 
brown bear stands beside Marble, and gives the girl 
a quick glance.  
“Don’t worry,” Marble assures her with a smile. 
“He’s on our side!” 
 
OK, boss fight time! Now as far as this young 
girl (whose name is Wren - she’s a recurring 
NPC in this town which the lads have only just 
met) I’m gonna have her make a contested 
Wisdom saving throw with the DC being set 
by an Intimidation check from the choker. I’m 
gonna use the spy statblock (CR1) because I 
think this girl could make a cool sidekick to my 
lads! 
Also, I think that quaal’s feather token my boys 
picked up before will help in this battle too… 
basically a bonus action attack. 
Hmm… perhaps this fight is going to be a little 
too easy. A sidekick + a new magic item… Do I 
need to add the cult fanatic as well? Let’s just 
calculate the difficulty of the encounter with the 
sidekick as well. 
Yeah, I’m gonna add a cult fanatic, and another 
choker as well, just to make it interesting. I 
always like my encounters to be at least hard. 
5e is pretty forgiving, after all.  
One thing - how I have written the BBEG 
encounter into the rules is that you reroll 
initiative, and run 5e combat as normal for the 
BBEG (in other words, don’t worry about the 
monster table roll etc). I am also going to use 
the Random Monster Combat AI (Chapter 5-1) 
for this encounter, just to provide a bit of 
randomness to monster actions. You wouldn’t 
do this with standard encounters in this system 
In order to use the Random Monster AI, first of 
all I need to determine what the base Menace 
Points value (X) is. This is the amount of 
menace points to add every time a character 
scores a hit on an enemy. What you do, as 
detailed in that chapter, is add the CRs of the 
monsters (2 Chokers, CR 1, gives us a result of 
2) and then you divide 20 by that number. 
So, X=10.  
 
COMBAT: ROUND ONE 
Wren’s Turn 
Wren, the new sidekick, goes first and wounds 
one of the chokers with her hand crossbow. It 
hits! For 8 points of damage.  
Menace Point score: +10.

---

## Page 288

Chokers’ Turn 
Now, the two chokers are going.  
Random Monster Combat AI roll: d100=41 + 
10 menace points = 10: Move and Attack 
nearest enemy using most powerful attack. 
Now, we get to playing the monsters true to 
form. They have a spider climb ability. Might 
they use that? Probably not, since they’ve just 
been hit with a crossbow, and also they are 
going up against a brown bear.  
I would say they are going to use their tentacle 
attack, which has a range of 10 ft. and the 
possibility of grappling. They also have 
aberrant quickness which allows them to take 
an extra action.  
So, both move on the foremost PC which is 
Abulu in his wildshape brown bear form. That 
is probably also the most significant threat.  
The first choker attacks, and hits! Abulu is 
grappled. I can just picture it, this horrid 
aberration wrapping its tentacle around the 
bear’s neck, the bear struggling to get free! It 
makes an advantage attack on Abulu, which 
hits. 
Now, the other choker… it does the same, 
maximising damage on Abulu. Two advantage 
attacks! Aaaand… the brown bear is down, 
which means Abulu reverts to bugbear druid 
form… Is he still grappled? Yep, he sure is.  
Wow. That was brutal.  
 
Cult Fanatic’s Turn 
The Cult Fanatic, let’s roll to see what he does. 
(Note: AOO stands for attack of opportunity). 
d100+5=84: FLEE (if Menace Points 20+ then 
Dash, incurring AOO) or USE DEFENSIVE 
FEATURE (e.g., healing, invisibility) or 
MAKE RANGED ATTACK or HOLD 
ACTION 
He won’t flee, because the menace points 
haven’t reached 20 yet, and the won’t use shield 
of faith because he probably doesn’t care that 
much about the chokers… so he’ll make a 
ranged sacred flame attack… which misses. 
I am glad that that happened… that last round 
was brutal. If he had not ranged attacks, he 
would have gone to “hold action.” That might 
sound a bit… weak if you’re not familiar with 
the system, but then at other times the AI roll 
will grant enemies a free attack, so it balances 
out. The main intention is just to provide a bit 
of unpredictability to enemy actions during 
combat. 
 
 
 
Abulu’s Turn 
Abulu is grappled, I’m wondering if he can use 
the Quaal’s token as a bonus action to attack 
first up… No, I think all he can do is use his 
action to escape. The DC is 15. And Marble 
can’t even help as he’s not adjacent! I’m being 
pretty mean to myself here, but it just means 
that if I win, I won’t have had to cut corners to 
get there. 
Strength check… I still have an inspiration 
too… 
First check fails. Use inspiration… that fails 
too! Noooo…. 
But he’ll use a clue point to re-award himself 
inspiration. The party now has just one clue 
point. 
 
Marble’s Turn 
Come on Marble! 
The warforged is just going to wade forward. 
Bonus action goes into rage of course. Then 
move and attack the choker that has Abulu in a 
grapple. The first one… misses! 
Use the inspiration... 
The second hits, for 12 damage! All right. 
Abulu is now no longer grappled, and one 
monster has gone down… 
Menace Points score=30 (this shot killed the 
monster, so add X twice).  
Marble will also take a clue point and convert it 
for inspiration.  
 
ROUND TWO 
Wren’s Turn 
Marble grants advantage to allies when he’s 
raging, so Wren is going to move up and take 
some of the heat off Abulu… 
She gets two shortsword attacks, which both 
hit!  
OK, 10 damage on the second choker! All of a 
sudden, we’re not looking too bad… 
But there’s still the cult fanatic… and the 
second choker ain’t dead yet… 
 
Choker’s Turn 
Random Monster Combat AI roll: d100+40 
Menace Points = 103. 
SURRENDER (if humanoid and at less than 
20% max HP) or TAKE COVER & ATTACK 
or (if no ranged attacks) ATTACK. 
It’s not humanoid, it’s an aberration, so it’s just 
going to attack. There Choker is going to try 
and nerf Marble with a grapple attack… 
First tentacle attack hits! Marble is grappled, 
dammit!

---

## Page 289

289 
 
Second attack is with advantage now… that 
also hits. And now, it’s going to use aberrant 
quickness to attack a third time. 
Brutal damage, but thankfully Marble is raging 
so it’s halved.  
 
Abulu’s Turn 
Now Abulu to the rescue! Hopefully. 
And he manages to do away with the last 
remaining choker using his Quaal’s feather 
token. Handy little trinket! 
Menace Points score = 60 (20 points added for 
the kill). 
 
Marble / Wren’s Turn 
Both Marble and Wren stalk up to the corner 
stealthily and ready action to attack if anything 
appears. 
  
Cult Fanatic’s Turn 
Let’s roll to see if he is still cowering in the 
shadows, the wretch! 
d100+60=81: FLEE (if Menace Points 20+ 
then Dash, incurring AOO) or USE 
DEFENSIVE FEATURE (e.g., healing, 
invisibility) or MAKE RANGED ATTACK or 
HOLD ACTION. 
The coward is going to flee! This guy (possibly 
a priest of Callister gone bad), the one 
potentially causing all this trouble, is going to 
try and escape the characters! 
Let’s make a Stealth roll. Can he flee quietly or 
does he alert the characters? 
He rolls an 8! The characters pursue! But will 
they be quick enough? 
 
Abulu’s Turn 
Abulu takes big loping strides down the 
passage, hot on the trail. Dash action. 
 
Marble’s Turn 
Marble dashes as well. 
 
Wren’s Turn 
Wren will use cunning action to dash as a 
bonus action! Every party needs a rogue… She 
aims with hand crossbow but misses. 
 
Cult Fanatic’s Turn 
He’s cornered here… what will he do? Is there 
a route of escape he can take? 
d100+60=100: He’s going to keep fleeing. 
Those steps lead down into darkness… 
 
The miscreant flees, down the broken stairs ahead, 
and into darkness. 
“Wait!” the young girl cries, the first words she has 
uttered so far. “Don’t go down there…” 
“What is down there?” Abulu asks, fixing her with 
hard stare.  
“It leads to catacombs… even the head priest is 
afraid to go, and he is a powerful man…” 
“Do we look weak to you?” Abulu asks. 
“No, not at all...but don’t throw your life away for 
these… so-called priests. They are not all they 
appear to be…” 
 
We are going to end that there… my guys are 
only level 3 and I feel like there’s some horrible 
stuff down there in those catacombs. They’ve 
uncovered part of the mystery, but the rest will 
have to wait! 
I hope this gave you a look into how the Urban 
Generator and Battlemap Crawl systems can be 
used. It’s also interesting to note that not all 
combats need to end with an all-out brawl. If 
the characters kill a few enemies, sometimes 
that will cause the remaining ones to flee, 
especially if they consistently roll high, as was 
the case here. The Random Monster Combat 
AI is designed to generate such situations.

Playthrough 4: 
Realm Crawl by Fitzgerald Limisella 
 
The party of adventurers had been tasked with finding a “bone weapon” that could be found in a 
graveyard far north east of the city. On the way, they would reach the northern desert known to 
grow “grains of paradise”, something they also needed. 
 
The party consisted of: 
1. Valeron Roshtan, a high elf Bladesinger wizard 
2. Malia Rondell, a half-elf Battle Smith artificer 
3. Nissili Symorin, a gnome druid of the Circle of Wildfire 
4. Huntagar Steelheart, a minotaur barbarian of the Path of Ancestral Guardian 
 
Party level: 7 
 
Did the party try and get riding horses for their journey? <Yes> 
 
Distance: 192 miles to the desert @ 48 miles / day <pre-determined as I have an existing map, so I didn’t 
create terrain/map as I went> 
 
Author’s note: I love Fitzgerald’s style here of pre-rolling several areas of terrain so he doesn’t have to do it 
step-by-step. This is a great example of how you can adapt the systems in the 2 Toolboxes to suit your own 
needs. I think I might try this myself some time.  
Another thing to note is Fitzgerald’s excellent interpretation of his rolls. He is able to extrapolate clues, enemies, 
and other random rolls into meaningful events with story underpinning it all. Creativity and imagination are 
essentials skill for a solo RPG player.

So the party set out and left the city of Stormsworth. About 24 miles into their journey, they were 
ambushed by a bulette.  
Or at least it tried to <bulette rolled 6 on Stealth check vs party’s lowest passive perception of 10>. It was 
easy enough to take down. 
 
After travelling for another 24 miles, the party reached a small forest. They arrived at this clear-
felled area and stumbled on a lone structure that looked very much like an inn or a tavern. 
 
 
As they entered, they were greeted by a seemingly nice lady behind the counter.

## Page 292

Did the party suspect anything? <No> They were probably too tired to notice anything unusual. 
Even Nissili, the most perceptive one in the party, did not feel anything was out of place <rolled nat 1 
on Insight check>. Sure enough, the “nice lady” transformed into a green hag and two others soon 
joined in; one bursting through the front door and the other through the back one. The party was 
now facing a coven.  
 
Somewhat surprised, Malia missed her shots although her Steel Defender managed to corner one hag. 
Valeron tried engaging the “barkeep” hag and successfully leaped across the counter <passed 
Acrobatics check vs DC10>. Nissili helped Valeron by casting <Flaming Sphere> to block the hag’s 
path. Huntagar used the opportunity to charge at the last hag and struck her. 
 
As a coven, the hags had access to fairly high-level spells, however the party’s resolve was too strong 
and none of their spells had too much impact <consistent successful saving throws vs hags’ spells>. 
Ultimately, one hag was taken down and the other two ran away. They were eventually captured and 
destroyed to prevent them from hurting other passers-by. Upon closer inspection, the party found 
clay pots containing foul-smelling materials back in the tavern, possibly the hags’ victims’ entrails. 
 
Throughout the journey, the party faced other adversaries, such as some bandits in training and 
weird fiends called vargouilles, which were identified by Valeron <rolled 25 on Arcana check>. 
 
 
With the help from the party, Valeron also managed to find the “grains of paradise” in the desert 
<rolled 20 on Nature check vs DC20>. The party decided to rest the night. They still had to make 
preparations for their next leg of the journey. On to the graveyard!

Summary Notes 
This was from an actual playthrough. There was a reason why the party was seeking these items 
(obviously), but it is not covered here. 
 
Adventure elements such as enemies, clues, items, features use the 6d12 method as per TSAT2. 
 
I did forget to resolve the log trap in Area 1 of the crawl. I decided that a log would probably affect 
the front character only, so I rolled a Dexterity saving throw for whoever it was at the front and they 
rolled high, so it was inconsequential. I also ignored the “mundane item” result. 
 
I also did not resolve the bandit stuff because I was getting tired and figured bandits are too low level 
anyway for these PCs. Between the Help action (for Advantage), Guidance spell (+1d4 for ability 
check) and Flash of Genius (an artificer’s feature that lets them add a modifier to an ability check), it 
would have been easy enough to intimidate these bandits. If all else fails, a well-placed Fireball would 
definitely scare them away. 
 
Random enemies are not 100% random. I randomised until I got something that I have miniatures for 
or something close. 
 
Italicised text refers to game mechanics, such as oracles and 5e ability checks. 
 
Underlined text refers to things or events that happened as a result of random rolls, e.g., type of 
enemies etc.

Playthrough 5: A Variety of Tools by Jorge Olayo 
 
I put in bold all the terms that refer to a specific 
resource of the material. 
So, my adventure is homebrew free style, but 
relies heavily on a map. It’s a map from a city 
that someone posted on a Facebook group, that 
includes a lot of descriptions about zones, 
districts and such. My intention is that my 
whole adventure happens in this city and the 
main objective for my character is to be a part 
of the ruling council, or be an actual power 
with strong influence over said council. 
So, my character is called Luheos Denoreth, 
he’s a level 5 rogue high elf, with a noble 
background and has spent almost a week in the 
city, so he’s still finding his way around, has 
made a big effort to stay out of trouble, and is 
trying not to attract attention to himself just 
yet. 
He also has an important thread about a magic 
ring which he “stole” from his former master, 
but he has it in a box that he’s almost certain is 
protected by magic, so he hasn’t attempted to 
open it. So, he’s looking for help with magic. 
He found a magical map in a hallway at the inn 
where he’s staying. He suspects it belongs to a 
particular NPC. I’d like this NPC to become 
Luheos’s sidekick, so that’s where I started my 
session. 
In the morning Luheos waited downstairs at 
the Inn for this young wizard, to see if he could 
follow him around during this day. 
But a couple of bad checks caused Luheos to 
quickly lose track of him. For all the Oracle 
questions, I use the TSAT2 oracle. I like it a 
lot, it’s easy and quick, and I do enjoy the 
prompt of the “no, but” and “yes, but” answers. 
The only added thing I use, is the if doubles are 
rolled, a random event occurs, as in the Mythic 
GM. 
 
Author’s note: It gives me great joy when players 
add their own tweaks to these systems. 
 
So, I rolled on the STREET EVENT table, and 
got a “Spirited group of minstrels”, which 
worked well as to explain why Luheos lost 
track of his target, there being a small crowd. 
Then with the Oracle it turned out that Luheos 
overheard 2 NPCs talking about a magic store, 
so he followed them. 
Here I tried out some of the Chapter 2-1: Urban 
Generator tables, but since I have a very detailed 
map of the city already, with districts well 
defined and all, the rolls were not making much 
sense. I don’t think there’s anything wrong 
with it, it just wasn’t working for my 
adventure. 
While following these NPCs, I made a 
perception check to see if there was anything 
particular from these 2 NPCs Luheos could 
notice, and I used the 4-4: KEYWORDS 
TABLE. I got the words “embrace”, “storm”, 
“ball”, and “nimble”, which I interpreted as a 
couple of nimble-looking elves devotees of a 
storm God (ignored "ball"). I dig this kind of 
resource a lot, I have used the one in TSAT1 
and the one on the Mythic GM, although I 
never liked very much the results on this last 
one. 
Since I wanted to run an encounter, I decided 
that they were going into the slums of the city. 
An actual bad insight roll caused Luheos to be 
lured into a dead-end alley for an ambush. I 
used the ALLEYWAY TABLE in Chapter 2-1: 
Urban Generator, to describe the alley they 
walked into. I determined that the alleyway 
was adjacent to a tavern, and that worked 
great. 
For the encounter, I used the TSAT 1 LEVEL 
5 Solo PC Encounter Calculator, rolled on the 
LEVEL 5: Easy table and got 2 CR 1⁄8 + 1 CR 
1⁄4 monsters, which I decided to be 2 cultists 
and one reskinned orc, as a strong human foe. 
So then, I used the Chapter 5-1: Running 
Combat and Monster Tactics. 
The formula states: “To calculate X, add up the 
CRs of all monsters, then divide 20 by that 
number and round down”, so I got 2 CR 1/8 
cultist + 1 CR 1/4 reskinned orc, which I 
understood as 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4, + 1/4 = 1/2 
which is = .5; then 20 / .5 = 40. So x = 40 
which is the base number to be added to the 
monsters Menace Points when rolling on the 
MONSTER ACTION table, and my 1st 
impression was that it was way too high, but it 
worked out very well. 
In the end, I killed the strongest one (reskinned 
Orc) and the remaining cultist tried to flee. 
With oracle and skill checks he could not go up 
a wall to escape, so Luheos grabbed him and 
interrogated him. 
There I used the RANDOM QUEST NAME 
TABLE, because Luheos had no previous 
relation to these cultists; and I liked the result a 
lot! I got "Escape from the Insane Priest", so I 
interpreted that the cultists are always on the

look for new sacrifice victims for their leader, 
an insane priest, and added this as a new 
thread. I liked this table a lot, and will use it 
whenever I need it. 
On another note, I love the 3-2: Urban 
Encounters section. It really helps my 
adventure. I had used one already from the 
TSAT1 and had a small incident on an alley, 
that ended up with Luheos gaining the favor of 
an office clerk of the Vigilance garrison. I will 
definitely be using this a lot. 
So, after the alley fight, Luheos was returning 
to the Inn district, when I rolled on the Skill 
Challenges table. I got "33 You see large, 
looming statues ahead, that stand like sentinels, 
on either side of a narrow throughway. Their 
eyes glow red, and you sense a trap of some 
sort. Perhaps they simply act as alarms, letting 
nearby enemies know of the presence of 
trespassers. Make a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) 
check to creep by these silent sentinels, or find 
another way around." so I made this happen on 
a small empty town square, and Luheos 
succeeded the stealth check. I really like all the 
challenges, and thanks for adding mine! it's 
number 99. 
 
Author note: Huge thanks for your contribution 
Jorge! Skill challenge 99 involves a ring of mind 
shielding and is very creative. Thank you also to the 
other players who contributed ideas for skill 
challenges. 
 
About the 2-3: CASTLE GENERATOR I 
wanted to give it a try, but as I was reviewing 
the tables, rolling on them didn’t make much 
sense in my adventure, since I already have the 
location and size of the castle. 
But what I did find very useful was the notes on 
the CASTLE CONDITION table. It made 
perfect sense that the castle in my city was in 
“excellent condition”, and “well-guarded”, 
getting in would be still very hard for my 
character right now. The castle will likely be 
one of the last locations my character may 
adventure, so I gave it a try and wasn’t 
successful at getting in. I gave it a try and 
failed the DC 18 Stealth check. 
So that’s all my input. Really enjoy your work, 
and I do have fun using it. Thanks! 
 
Author note: I’d just like to say once more, a
